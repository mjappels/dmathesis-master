When a coordinate transformation is used, or any general transformation or
relabelling, it will be represented in either one of the following manners. In
going from the coordinates/parameters $\{x^i\}$ to the coordinates/parameters
$\{y^i\}$, a simple relation will be provided as either
\begin{align*}
  x^i = x^i(\{y^i\})\qquad \mbox{or} \qquad y^i = y^i(\{x^i\}),
\end{align*}
where clarity will be the determining factor. alternatively, it will be more
desirable to preserve some particular characters on either ends of the
transformation. when this is the case, the set of coordinates/parameters
$\{x^i\}$ is to be replaced, as they appear in any expression, with, for
example, a primed set $\{x'^i\}$, for which a relation such as those above
will be provided. The replacement procedure is represented by an arrow $\to$,
the direction of which indicates which variable is being replaced (the
tail). This is then followed by the relation to the original
variable. Explicitly,
\begin{align*}
  x^i \to x'e^i=x'^i(\{x^i\}) \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad x^i \to x'^i(\{x^i\}),
\end{align*}
where we have introduced a commonly used shorthand in the second expression
signifying simply that ``$\to$'' is to be interpreted as meaning
``$\to x'^i =$''.

\section{The Laws of Black Hole Mechanics}
\label{sec:fourlaws}

In 1971, Stephen Hawking (SWH) discovered that there exists an upper bound on the
amount of energy that can be released through gravitational radiation --- or any
other form of energy release, for that matter --- upon the collision of two
black holes~\cite{Hawking:1971tu,Hawking:1971vc}. This result relies primarily
on a proof that through any given physical process, such as a collision or a
capture of sorts, the total event horizon area should never decrease, thereby
constraining how much energy may be extracted. Now known as Hawking's
\emph{black hole area theorem}, the result of this proof is commonly written as:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:areatheorem}
  \mathcal{A}_3 \geqslant \mathcal{A}_1+\mathcal{A}_2
\end{align}
This theorem has an important role in the history of black hole thermodynamics
as it is responsible for much of the reasoning that was applied to this analogy,
in that it is clearly reminiscent of the second law of thermodynamics, and we
shall explore these parallels in greater depth below. Along with the area
theorem, in~\cite{Hawking:1971vc}, SWH also shows that under a gravitationally
collapsing body of matter will not only form a black hole, but that the event
horizon of the black hole formed will have a spherical topology and the black
hole itself will be stationary and axisymmetric, a result which we will
reference back to in\todoopt{section ultraspinning}.

During the summer of 1972, Bardeen, Carter and Hawking (BCH) pursued the
aforementioned analogy between the macroscopic properties of black holes and
thermodynamical systems, work which culminated in the formalisation of \emph{the
  four laws of black hole mechanics}~\cite{Bardeen:1973gs}, a homage to their
statistical counterparts. Let us now summarise these laws as such:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{zeroth law} states that the surface gravity $\kappa$ of a
  stationary black hole is constant over its event
  horizon~\cite{Bardeen:1973gs,Hawking:1973qla,Carter:1973rla,Carter2009,
    Carter2010}.
\item The \emph{first law} expresses conservation of energy during physical
  processes through changes in the properties of the black hole such as its mass
  $M$, area $\mathcal{A}$, angular momentum $J$ or charge $Q$ with the following
  relation:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:firstlawBHM}
    \delta M = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \delta \mathcal{A} + \Omega \delta J + \Phi
    \delta Q, 
  \end{align}
  where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the black hole at its event horizon
  and $\Phi$ is the electrostatic potential. This relation was proved using a
  variational principle by BCH in the uncharged case, and Carter published the
  proof for the charged case in the conference proceedings for the summer
  school~\cite{Carter:1973rla} (repub. in~\cite{Carter2010}). We review this
  work in \cref{sec:firstlaw}.
\item The \emph{second law} is the area theorem itself. Following the current
  theme, we re-express \cref{eq:areatheorem} simply as:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:secondlaw}
    \delta\mathcal{A}\geqslant 0.
  \end{align}
\item Finally, the \emph{third law} states that it is impossible through any
  finite sequence of physical processes to reduce the surface gravity $\kappa$
  to zero. At the time, this law was only conjectured and argued for using
  logical arguments. It had actually been shown that processes leading to such a
  configuration did exist if one allowed for infinite divisibility of matter and
  infinite time~\cite{Christodoulou:1970wf,Bardeen:1970zz}. Werner Israel proved
  the third law a decade later~\cite{Israel:1986gqz} .
\end{itemize} 

The analogy between black hole mechanics and classical thermodynamics is
complete once some form of identification is made between the surface gravity
$\kappa$ and the temperature $T$, and between the horizon area $\mathcal{A}$ and
the entropy $S$, both up to some factor determined such that
$T\delta S = \kappa \delta \mathcal{A} / 8\pi$. The authors
of~\cite{Bardeen:1973gs} were initially reluctant to make this identification
and emphasized that while the similarities existed, these quantities should not
lead to the interpretation of the black hole as having either temperature or
entropy, and understandably so---classically, the effective temperature of a
black hole is absolute zero, as it is (or at least was thought to be) unable to
emit any radiation. In fact, they point out that black holes transcend the
second law in that one might in theory be able to add entropy to a black hole
without changing its final state by much. The concept of horizon area as entropy
was not, however, a new one.

Little over half a year prior to \emph{The four laws of black hole mechanics}
was received for publication, and only a couple of months before the
aforementioned summer school during which much of this work was conceived (but a
year after Hawking's initial paper on the area theorem was published), Jacob
Bekenstein (JB) wrote in a letter addressing this specific apparent violation of the
second law of thermodynamics~\cite{Bekenstein:1972tm}. In the letter, he
proposes a generalised form of the second law of thermodynamics in which the
quantity that is observed to never decrease is given by the sum of common
entropy, the entropy of the spacetime outside the black hole and a new
\emph{black hole entropy} proportional to the horizon area, ie.
$S_{\mathrm{bh}}=\eta \mathcal{A}$, with $\eta$ an as-yet-undetermined
proportionality constant. This choice of having entropy proportional to the
horizon area was actually motivated by Hawking's work on the area
theorem~\cite{Hawking:1971tu} as well as similar work by Christodoulou and
Ruffini around the same time~\cite{Christodoulou:1970wf,Christodoulou:1972kt} on
reversible and irreversible processes for black holes. In further
works~\cite{Bekenstein:1973ur,Bekenstein:1974ax}, JB attempts to establish the
proportionality factor on heuristic grounds and proposes a value for
$\eta=\log(2)/8\pi$. In fact, by considering a differential formula akin to the
first law (\cref{eq:firstlawBHM}), JB was actually able to postulate a possible
expression for the temperature, by considering the conjugate quantity to
entropy; however he too warns against interpreting this as a true temperature in
the thermal sense. That black holes could not seemingly have a nonzero
temperature proved to be the obstacle preventing Bekenstein's work on black hole
entropy from catching on in other circles early on~\cite{10.2307/24953849}.

In the early 1970s, a classical mechanism for stimulated emission from a black
hole had been discovered, known as superradiance. It describes the amplification
of waves in a special \emph{superradiant regime}, incident on a generic
Kerr-Newman black hole. The easiest way to see this effect is by considering a
wave packet of frequency $\omega$, axial quantum number $m$ and charge $e$,
incident on a black hole. The first law (\cref{eq:firstlawBHM}) should hold
throughout the capture of this packet and one expects differentials in the
ratios of $m:\omega$ and $e:\omega$. It therefore follows that
\begin{align}
  \left(1-\Omega \frac{m}{\omega}-\Phi\frac{e}{\omega}\right) \delta M = \frac{\kappa}{8\pi}\delta\mathcal{A}.
\end{align}
Imposing the second law (\cref{eq:secondlaw}) allows for $\delta M \leqslant 0$
for wave packets that satisfy
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:superradiant}
  \omega \leqslant \Omega m + \Phi e.
\end{align}
In other words, we expect wave packets incident in this superradiant regime to be
scattered off the black hole with a larger amplitude.

This effect can be traced back to works by Yakov
Zel'dovich~\cite{Zeldovich:1970aa,Zeldovich:1972aa}, however it was also
separately pointed out by Misner~\cite{Misner:1972kx}, apparently unaware of
Zel'dovich's work. Other notable contributions to the understanding of this
amplifications were made by Press and Teukolsky~\cite{Press:1972zz},
Starobinskii~\cite{Starobinskii:1973aa} and by
Bekenstein~\cite{Bekenstein:1973mi}. While most of the work cited above concerns
itself with the amplification of superradiant incident waves through stimulated
emission, Zel'dovich also suggested that, taking into account quantum mechanical
effects, one could in principle also expect spontaneous emission in superradiant
modes as well. Writing in his thesis, Don Page describes how, oblivious to
Zel'dovich's work, he and Larry Ford had at the time independently discovered
this effect, eventually going on to have discussions with Feynman, Thorne, Press
and Teukolsky, before being made aware of the
above~\cite{Page:1976zz} (along with a few amusing anecdotes from the time in~\cite{Page:2006my}).

What is important to note here is that while it was universally accepted that a
black hole could not radiate, a black hole emitting in superradiant modes would
technically not violate the second law of black hole mechanics, by
definition. It should come, therefore, as no surprise that when Hawking
eventually heard about this effect, as it made its way across research circles,
his interest was piqued and, after having discussions with Zel'dovich and
Starobinskii while in Moscow, began working on a field theory calculation that
might help in validifying this quantum phenomenon~\cite{Page:2006my}.

In 1974, Hawking made the groundbreaking discovery that not only did black holes
radiate in these superradiant modes, but that emission from black holes in fact
covered as much of the spectrum it
could~\cite{Hawking:1974rv,Hawking:1974sw}. Hawking himself, later writes, in
retrospect~\cite{10.2307/24953849}, about how he was initially embarrassed by
the result and therefore attempted to introduce various cutoffs in an effort to
suppress these additional modes. He eventually accepted the result, citing the
fact that the radiation was identical to thermal radiation from a body with
temperature $\kappa/2\pi$ as the smoking gun. Another reason Hawking ended up
believing in his result was that it made Bekenstein's theory of black hole
entropy consistent. This result has since been verified by several other
means~\cite{Bekenstein:1975tw,DeWitt:1975ys,Parker:1975jm,Hawking:1974sw,Wald:1975kc,Gerlach:1976ji,Hartle:1976tp,Unruh:1976db,Boulware:1975fe,Davies:1976ei,Hawking:1976de}
and is generally accepted as a correct result, despite our lack, still to this
day, of a consistent picture of quantum gravity.

Hawking temperature, in a sense, was the final piece of the puzzle and the
reason why black hole mechanics became black hole \emph{thermodynamics}. With the
expression Hawking found, we are now able to rewrite the first law as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:firstlaw}
  \delta M = T_\mathrm{H} \delta S_\mathrm{BH} + \Omega \delta J + \Phi \delta Q,
\end{align}
where the temperature of the black hole is known as the \emph{Hawking
  temperature}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:hawkingtemperature}
  T_\mathrm{H}=\frac{\kappa}{2\pi},
\end{align}
and the entropy of the black hole is known as the \emph{Bekenstein-Hawking
  entropy}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:BHentropy}
  S_\mathrm{BH}=\frac{\mathcal{A}}{4}.
\end{align}
Similarly, we promote the second law to the aforementioned generalised second
law, with the black hole entropy given by a quarter the horizon area.

\section{The First Law}
\label{sec:firstlaw}

When Roy Kerr first presented the metric for a rotating black hole in
1963~\cite{Kerr:1963ud}, most commonly written in Boyer-Lindquist\footnote{Boyer
  and Lindquist were responsible for the maximal extension of the Kerr
  metric~\cite{Boyer:1966qh}. Boyer-Lindquist coordinates are coordinates best
  suited for describing ellipsoids and are related to cartesian coordinates
  through $ x = \sqrt{r^2+a^2}\sin\theta\cos\phi$,
  $y = \sqrt{r^2 + a^2}\sin\theta \sin \phi$ and $z=r\cos\theta$.} coordinates
as
\begin{gather}
  ds^2 = -\frac{f(r)}{\Sigma}(dt - a \sin^2 \theta d\phi)^2 +
  \frac{\Sigma}{f(r)}dr^2 + \Sigma r^2 d\theta^2 + \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\Sigma
  r^2}(adt - (r^2+a^2)d\phi)^2,\nn\\
  f(r) = 1- \frac{2m}{r} + \frac{a^2+e^2}{r^2}, \qquad \Sigma = 1+\frac{a^2}{r^2}\cos^2\theta,
  \label{eq:kerrAF}
\end{gather}
\todoopt{find potentials}
he provided an interpretation for the solution parameters $m$ and $a$ by
comparing its Taylor expansion to a previously known approximation of a spinning
particle, and concluded that to an observer at infinity this rotating black hole
would be equivalent to a particle of mass $M=m$ and angular momentum $J=ma$. The
charge term in $f(r)$ was later added by Newman \emph{et
  al.}~\cite{Newman:1965my} and a similar line of reasoning leads one to
conclude that a Kerr-Newman black hole with nonzero charge parameter $e$ has an
electric charge $Q = e$.

In 1969, Penrose provided a simple mechanism through which one could envision
extracting the rotational energy of a Kerr black hole~\cite{Penrose:1969pc}, and
in 1970, Christodoulou~\cite{Christodoulou:1970wf,Christodoulou:1972kt} (with
Ruffini, in 1971) showed using this picture that a black hole's mass could be
decomposed using an irreducible mass $M_\mathrm{ir}$, which represents the mass
of the remaining black hole when all its rotational and electromagnetic energy
is stripped, according to the following formula:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:christodoulou-ruffini}
  M=\sqrt{\left(M_\mathrm{ir}+\frac{Q^2}{4M_\mathrm{ir}}\right)^2 + \frac{J^2}{4M_\mathrm{ir}^2}}.
\end{align}
Christodoulou and Ruffini point out that this is equivalent in principle to
Hawking's area theorem and one can indeed obtain \cref{eq:christodoulou-ruffini}
by treating $M_\mathrm{ir}$ as the mass of a Schwarzschild black hole with equal
area to a generic Kerr-Newman black hole. One then deduces
$M_\mathrm{ir}^2 = \mathcal{A}/16\pi$. An appealing aspect of this definition is
the resemblance it bears to the energy of a relativistic particle, when
expressed in terms of its rest mass and momentum.

In 1972, Larry Smarr pointed out, using this relation, that if one expressed
mass as a function $M=M(\mathcal{A},J,Q)$ of area, angular momentum and charge,
the exact differential
\begin{align}
dM = \mathcal{T}d\mathcal{A} + \Omega dJ + \Phi dQ
\end{align}
could be used to obtain the invariant quantities
$\mathcal{T} = (\partial M/\partial A)_{J,Q} = \kappa/8\pi$, referred to at the
time as the effective surface tension, $\Omega=(\partial M/\partial J)_{A,Q}$,
the angular velocity of the black hole, and
$\Phi = (\partial M/\partial Q)_{A,J}$, the electromagnetic potential. Smarr
then simply observed that with these quantities, \cref{eq:christodoulou-ruffini}
could be rewritten nicely as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:smarrrelation}
  M = 2\mathcal{T}\mathcal{A} + 2\Omega J + \Phi Q.
\end{align}
In fact, this result follows immediately from Euler's theorem on homogeneous
functions, given that $M(\lambda\mathcal{A}, \lambda J, \lambda^\frac12 Q) =
\lambda^\frac12 M(\mathcal{A},J,Q)$.
\todoopt{mention Bekenstein}

We began this section by pointing out that the origin of the interpretations of
mass and angular momentum as $M = m$ and $J = ma$ was a term-by-term comparison
with what might be expected in some low-energy limit. While this was a practical
approach, a formal method for identifying such conserved charges had in fact
already been developed by Arthur Komar in 1958~\cite{Komar:1959aa}. A conserved
current can be formed by contracting a killing vector $k$ with the Ricci
tensor. The corresponding conserved quantity is obtained by integrating this
current over a spacelike hypersurface $\mathcal{S}$ normal to the killing
vector. Using the fact that a killing vector satisfies
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:killing}
  \nabla_a \nabla^a k^b = -R^b_{~a}k^a,
\end{align}
a \emph{Komar integral} associated to a given killing vector is derived
as\todoopt{I'm pretty sure the 2 should be there...}\todoruth{I'm not. have you
  considered the factor of 2 from $d\Sigma^{ab}\partial_ak_b$?}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:komar}
  E_k\sim\int_{\partial\mathcal{S}} \nabla^a k^b ~ d\Sigma_{ab} = 2\int_{\partial\mathcal{S}} * \mathrm{\mathbf{d}}k,
\end{align}
where a normalisation is needed, which can be determined at a later stage, and
$d\Sigma_{ab}$ is the volume element on $\partial \mathcal{S}$, to give a
conserved charge $E_k$. One finds that for $k = k_t$ the timelike killing
vector, and for $k = k_\phi$, the rotational killing vector, this integral, when
evaluated at infinity $\partial \mathcal{S}_\infty$ and normalised, yields
$M = m$ and $J = m a$ respectively, for the Kerr-Newman metric. One can
construct a spacelike surface $S$ which ends only on the boundary and extends
through the horizons to the singularity.

Bardeen, Carter and Hawking were able to prove Smarr's relation, for the
uncharged case in a more general setting in~\cite{Bardeen:1973gs} and Carter
provided the proof for the charged case
in~\cite{Carter:1973rla,Carter2010}. Both methods use this as an intermediary
step to deriving the first law. We will now briefly review this calculation,
omitting technical steps which can certainly all be found in the original works.

Let us consider the Komar integrals for both killing vectors, evaluated over a
surface $\mathcal{S}$ which now extends from the boundary
$\partial \mathcal{S}_\infty$ and the event horizon $\partial
\mathcal{B}$. Integrating both sides of \cref{eq:killing} will allow us to
express mass and angular momentum as
\begin{align}
  M &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_\mathcal{S} R^a_{~b}k^b_t ~d\Sigma_a + M_\mathrm{H}, 
  &M_\mathrm{H} &\equiv -\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\partial \mathcal{B}}\nabla^a k_t^b ~ d\Sigma_{ab},\nn\\
  J &= -\frac{1}{8\pi}\int_\mathcal{S} R^a_{~b}k^b_\phi ~d\Sigma_a + J_\mathrm{H}, 
  &J_\mathrm{H} &\equiv \frac{1}{8\pi}\int_{\partial\mathcal{B}}\nabla^a k_\phi^b ~ d\Sigma_{ab},
\label{eq:smarrder1}
\end{align}
where $M_\mathrm{H}$ and $J_\mathrm{H}$ are the corresponding boundary integrals
evaluated at the horizon. For vacuum metrics, $M_\mathrm{H}=M=m$ and
$J_\mathrm{H}=J=ma$. The null generator of the horizon can be defined as
$l^a = k_t^a + \Omega_\mathrm{H} k_\phi^a$, where $\Omega_\mathrm{H}$ is a
scalar quantity which is obtained from the requirement that $l$ be orthogonal to
the rotational killing vector $k_\phi$. It can further be shown that
$\Omega_\mathrm{H}$, given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:angularvelocity}
  \Omega_\mathrm{H} = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}},
\end{align}
is constant over the horizon and represents its angular velocity. Making use of
the fact that the surface gravity $\kappa$ can actually be defined in terms of
this vector as $\kappa = n_bl^a\nabla_al^b$, where $n$ is the unit normal to the
horizon, one eliminates $M_\mathrm{H}$ from \cref{eq:smarrder1}, establishing
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:smarrder2}
  \frac12 M = \int_\mathcal{S} \left(T^a_{~b} - \frac12 T \delta^a_b\right)k_t^b~d\Sigma_a + \Omega_\mathrm{H}
  J_\mathrm{H} + \frac{\kappa \mathcal{A}}{8\pi},
\end{align}
which reduces to the Smarr relation in the absence of charge and any external
matter. A further decomposition can be made by splitting the stress-energy
tensor $T^{ab} = T_\mathrm{M}^{ab} + T_\mathrm{F}^{ab}$ into its matter and
electromagnetic parts, which in turn allows us to express the total angular
momentum $J = J_\mathrm{M} + J_\mathrm{F} + J_\mathrm{H}$ in a similar
fashion. Finally, one can define the electric charge by integrating the
electromagnetic current $j^a = \nabla_b F^{ab}/4\pi$ over the same spacelike
surface, and, in analogy to the mass and the angular momentum formulae in
\cref{eq:smarrder1} we write it as
\begin{align}
  Q = -\int_\mathcal{S} j^a ~d\Sigma_a + Q_\mathrm{H}, \qquad Q_\mathrm{H} \equiv -\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\partial\mathcal{B}}F^{ab} ~ d\Sigma_{ab}.
\end{align}
It then follows that \cref{eq:smarrder2} can be rearranged into
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:smarrder3}
  \frac12 M &= \int_\mathcal{S} \left(T^a_{\mathrm{M}~b} - \frac12 T_\mathrm{M}
  \delta^a_b\right)k_t^b~d\Sigma_a - \Omega_\mathrm{H} J_\mathrm{M} - \frac12
\int_\mathcal{S} l^c A_c j^a~d\Sigma_a + \int_\mathcal{S} A_b j^{[b}l^{a]}~d\Sigma_a \nn\\
&\hspace{5em}+ \Omega_\mathrm{H} J + \frac{\kappa \mathcal{A}}{8\pi} + \frac12
\Phi_\mathrm{H} Q_\mathrm{H},
\end{align}
and the Smarr relation is now recovered when the external matter fields and
source currents in the first line are switched off.

The formula in \cref{eq:smarrder3} describes the total mass $M$ of the system,
which is a time-conserved quantity. It is possible, however, to look at two
neighbouring configurations with slightly different $M$, and consider the
corresponding variation $\delta M$, similar to the way in which one varies the
action. It is by performing this variation that one obtains the first law in its
most general form for a rotating charged black hole surrounded by electric and
matter fields:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:firstlawder1}
  \delta M &= \int \Omega\delta dJ_\mathrm{M} + \int \overline{\Theta}\delta dS +
  \int \overline{\mu}^{(i)} \delta dN_{(i)} +\int \Phi_\mathcal{S}\delta dQ \nn\\
  &\hspace{12em}+ \Phi_\mathrm{H} \delta
  Q_\mathrm{H} + \frac{\kappa}{8\pi}\delta\mathcal{A} + \Omega_\mathrm{H}(\delta
  J_\mathrm{H}+\delta J_\mathrm{F}),
\end{align}
where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the fluid, $\overline{\Theta}$ is its
``effective'' or ``red-shifted'' temperature, $\overline{\mu}^{(i)}$ the
effective chemical potential corresponding to each type of particle,
$\Phi_\mathcal{S}$ denotes the electromagnetic potential accross the surface
$\mathcal{S}$, and finally the notation ``$\int\delta d$'' signifies a change in
fluid angular momentum ($J_\mathrm{M}$), entropy ($S$) or particle number
($N_{(i)}$) crossing the surface $\mathcal{S}$. This elegant result reduces to
the relation initially presented in \cref{eq:firstlawBHM} when all external
fields and sources are turned off.

\section{The Euclidean Approach to Black Hole Thermodynamics}
\label{sec:euclidean}

By the end of 1975, Hawking had already devised a way, with Jim Hartle, to
reproduce his black hole radiation calculation using the path-integral
formulation of quantum field theory~\cite{Hartle:1976tp}. In this approach, the
central object is the partition function, which has the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partitionfunction1}
  Z = \int \mathcal{D}g \mathcal{D} \Phi~e^{iS[g,\Phi]},
\end{align}
where we are integrating over the space of all possible metrics, including those
which are topologically distinct spacetimes such as black hole solutions, and
all field configurations. It was then shown, by Gibbons and Hawking in
1976~\cite{Gibbons:1976ue}, that, given a properly regularised gravitational
action, it was possible to recover all the thermodynamic behaviour of black hole
mechanics from the partition function, in analogy to regular euclidean field
theory.

The action in \cref{eq:partitionfunction1} for a generic gravitational solution
is given by
\begin{align}
  S = -\frac{1}{16\pi}\int_Y d^4x \sqrt{-g} R - \frac{1}{8\pi}\int_{\partial
  Y}d^3x\sqrt{-h}K + S_\mathrm{C} + S_\mathrm{M}.
\end{align}
It is computed within a region of spacetime $Y$ and is made up of the
Einstein-Hilbert, Gibbons-Hawking, counter and matter terms respectively. $R$ is
the Ricci scalar for the bulk metric $g_{ab}$, $K$ is the extrinsic curvature of the
boundary $\partial Y$ and $h_{ab}$ is its induced three-dimensional metric. The
counterterm $S_\mathrm{C}$ is determined such that $S$ vanishes in flat space.

An issue that arises when computing the action of a black hole metric is that
singularities must be avoided. While it is known that crafty coordinate choices
allow one to patch over horizons, curvature singularities are intrinsic to the
geometry and may not be removed. It is possible, however, to construct a smooth
patch which avoids the singularity all together, by complexifying the timelike
coordinate. The subsequent spacetime will only be smooth provided the new
coordinate $\tau=it$ is made to have a periodicity $\beta = 2\pi/\kappa$, where
$\kappa$ is the surface gravity of the horizon. Let us illustrate this with the
Schwarzschild metric,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:schwarzschildAF}
  ds^2 = -f(r)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{f(r)} + r^2 d\Omega^2, \qquad f(r) = 1-\frac{2m}{r}.
\end{align}
In the vicinity of the horizon $r_\mathrm{h} = 2m$, the Euclidean Schwarzschild
metric will take the form given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:schwarzschildAFE}
  ds^2 = f'(r_\mathrm{h})(r-r_\mathrm{h})d\tau^2+
  \frac{dr^2}{f'(r_\mathrm{h})(r-r_\mathrm{h})}+r_h^2 d\Omega^2.  
\end{align}
Introducing temporary coordinates $\rho = 2\sqrt{r-r_\mathrm{h}}$ and
$\varphi = f'(r_\mathrm{h})\tau/2$, it becomes clear that with
$\beta = f'(r_\mathrm{h})/4\pi = 8\pi m$, these coordinates describe a spacetime
of topology $S^1 \times S^2$. More precisely, each point in the $\tau-r$
subspace corresponds to a 2-sphere of corresponding radius, and the subspace
itself has an $S^1$ symmetry centred around the point $r = r_\mathrm{h}$. One
could then compute the action on a region bounded by the surface
$r = r_\mathrm{b}$.

In euclidean field theory, the periodicity of imaginary time ends up
corresponding to the temperature of the system through $T=\beta^{-1}$. This is
then used to express the partition function of such a field theory. In the grand
canonical ensemble, such a system will have thermodynamically conserved
quantities $Q_i$, and respective conjugate potentials $P_i$. The partition
function can be expressed as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partitionfunction2}
  Z = \Tr e^{-\beta\left(H - \sum_iP_i Q_i\right)} = \Tr e^{-\beta F},
\end{align}
where $F$ is the grand canonical free energy potential, or ``grand potential''
for short --- in the current text, however, this quantity will loosely be
referred to as the \emph{free energy potential}, and will be defined according
to the ensemble at hand.

Returning to the gravitational partition function, it follows from the
path-integral approach that the integral in \cref{eq:partitionfunction1} will
receive its most dominant contributions from the on-shell metric, that which
satisfies Einstein's equations. This allows us to use the following
approximation for the partition function, using the euclidean action,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:partitionfunction3}
  Z  \approx e^{-S_\mathrm{E}[g,\Phi]}.
\end{align}
In analogy with the non-gravitational situation, we derive the free energy
from the partition function using \cref{eq:partitionfunction2}, and write
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:freeenergy1}
  F = -\frac{\log Z}{\beta}=\frac{S_\mathrm{E}}{\beta}.
\end{align}
Finally, one recovers an expression for the mass of the black hole by reverse
Legendre transforming the free energy:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:massfromaction}
  M &= F + TS + \sum_iP_i Q_i\nn\\
    &= 2TS + 2\Omega J + \Phi Q
\end{align}
for the Kerr-Newman black hole. Historically, this was used to affirm the
expression for entropy using the Smarr formula from \cref{eq:smarrrelation},
however it could equally be used to verify the converse.


\section{Incorporating $\Lambda$}

\placehold{Generic intro to AdS and interest in it since Maldacena}

Early research concerning gravitational solutions which included a cosmological
constant was seen as purely academic at the time.
\begin{itemize}
\item astronomical discovery
\item diversifies landscape of solutions
\item Cosmological motivations, research into inflation, bubbles?
\item AdS/CFT and applications for studying qfts as well as condensed matter systems.
\end{itemize}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:lambda}
  \Lambda = -\frac{(D-1)(D-2)}{2\ell^2} = -\frac{3}{\ell^2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Thermodynamics of the Kerr-AdS Black Hole}

The obvious starting point for introducing a cosmological constant is to review
how this fits into the thermodynamic framework for studying black holes
presented above. The thermodynamics of black holes in the context of a
cosmological constant were actually first discussed in a paper by Gibbons and
Hawking in 1976~\cite{Gibbons:1977mu}, in which they discuss hawking radiation
and black hole temperature in a de Sitter ($\Lambda > 0)$ background, a delicate
topic since de Sitter space also has a cosmological horizon. The original
motivation of the paper was in fact to better define the hawking radiation
associated to cosmological horizons. In 1982, Hawking and Page presented a
thermodynamic description of the Schwarzschild-AdS
spacetime~\cite{Hawking:1982dh}. By computing the action using a regularisation
scheme similar to the method presented in \cref{sec:euclidean}, adapted to an
asymptotically-AdS spacetime, HP derive expressions for the temperature and
entropy of the black hole in this background and in fact used these quantities
to show that there existed a phase transition for black holes in an anti-de
Sitter background, which we will review below.

While the Kerr-AdS metric has been known since the late
1960s~\cite{Carter:1968ks}, its thermodynamics were only discussed near the turn
of the century, when interest in asymptotically-AdS solutions boomed due to the
aforementioned AdS/CFT
conjecture~\cite{Hawking:1998kw,Caldarelli:1999xj,Silva:2002jq,Gibbons:2004ai}. The
metric, in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, is given by
\begin{align}
  ds^2 &= -\frac{f(r)}{\Sigma}\Big(dt - a \sin^2 \theta \frac{d\phi}{\Xi}\Big)^2 +
         \frac{\Sigma}{f(r)}dr^2 + \frac{\Sigma r^2}{g(\theta)} d\theta^2 \nn\\
  &\hspace{15em}+ \frac{g(\theta)\sin^2\theta}{\Sigma r^2}\Big(adt -
    (r^2+a^2)\frac{d\phi}{\Xi}\Big)^2,
    \label{eq:kerrAdS}
\end{align}
where
\begin{gather}
f(r) = \Big(1 + \frac{a^2}{r^2}\Big) \Big(1 + \frac{r^2}{\ell^2}\Big) -
\frac{2m}{r}+\frac{e^2}{r^2}, \qquad g(\theta) = 1 -
\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\cos^2\theta, \nn\\ 
\Sigma = 1+\frac{a^2}{r^2}\cos^2\theta,\qquad \Xi = 1-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}.
\end{gather}

\chapter{The C-metric}
\label{sec:cmet}

\section{Origins of the C-metric}
\label{sec:cmet-history}

The first non-trivial solution to the Einstein field equations of General
Relativity appeared within a month or two of their publication\todoruth{do you
  know the dates? Maybe a bit less specific?}. It was Karl Schwarszchild who in
1915 (published in 1916) initially discovered the spacetime and presented it as
the most general solution to describe a spherically-symmetric solution to the
vacuum field equations~\cite{Schwarzschild:1916ab, Schwarzschild:1916aa,
  Schwarzschild:1916ea}. This solution went largely misunderstood for the next
few decades as various attempts were made to understand the singularities the
metric contains. It wasn't until 1958 that David Finkelstein, using a set of
coordinates earlier published by Arthur Eddington that smoothly
\todoruth{patched through? extended across?}patched the coordinate singularity,
provided the interpretation of this singularity as a surface which could only be
traversed in one direction~\cite{Finkelstein:1958aa}. The spacetime eventually
went on to become known as the Schwarszchild black hole, however it is easy to
forget how much time elapsed between the discovery of the solution and for a
widely accepted interpretation to be presented.

Within the first few years of the field equations being known, other solutions
were found. These were mostly mathematical solutions whose physical meanings
were unknown, much like the Schwarzschild metric. Of particular interest to this
thesis is a metric belonging to a larger class of solutions discovered by
Levi-Civita \todoruth{cite}in 1918.\todoopt{KW refers to a ``soluzioni
  oblique''} The class of metrics he describes are those spacetimes which admit
a \textit{``timelike Killing vector $\xi^a$ orthogonal to a three-space whose
  Ricci curvature tensor is of the form:''}\todoopt{literally copied wording
  from KW - fix}
\begin{align}
  R^a_{~b}=\alpha \eta^a \eta_b + \beta \delta^a_{~b}.
\end{align}

This metric would then be rediscovered in the early 1960s, in a wave of research
presumably inspired by the aforementioned \todoruth{understanding}advent of
black holes, by Newman and Tamburino~\cite{Newman:1961aa}, Robinson and
Trautman~\cite{Robinson:1962zz} and then again by Ehlers and
Kundt~\cite{Ehlers:1962aa}. In particular, Ehlers and Kundt explicitly take the
initial body of work laid out by Levi-Civita, cited above, and, in their own
words, ``follow his line of thought'' and ``simplified and completed his
derivations''. They continue on to present an invariant classification of
degenerate static vacuum fields\todoopt{provide explanation of
  clarification?}. It is this classification of ``A'', ``B'' and ``C''-type
metrics which gives its name, to this day, to the \emph{C-metric}, the
axisymmetric vacuum solution describing an accelerating black
hole. \todoopt[inline]{``C''-metrics are metrics for which the hypersurface
  $T_\tau$ --- which contain the orbits of the complete isometry group of a
  degenrate static vacuum field --- contain neither the spacelike nor the
  timelike eigensurfaces belonging to the Riemann tensor's special eigenscalar
  $\alpha$...} \todoruth{At what point? Now? 60s?}At this point, the C-metric is
not yet fully understood, but it is seen as a metric that bridges the gap
between the Schwarzschild metric and its charged counterpart
(Reissner-Nordstrom), and the Weyl and Robinson-Trautman
solutions~\cite{Kinnersley:1970zw}.

Eventually, in 1970, Kinnersley and Walker~\cite{Kinnersley:1970zw} picked up
the C-metric and finally provided the interpretation of this solution as an
\emph{accelerated} black hole. Let us now review how KW obtained their version
of the C-metric. The Levi-Civita solution is given in the form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:levi-civita-metric}
  ds^2 = \frac{1}{(x+y)^2} \left(-F(y)dt^2 + \frac{dy^2}{F(y)} + \frac{dx^2}{G(x)}
  + G(x) dz^2\right)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  G(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad F(y) = -G(-y),
\end{align}
with $a_0\ldots a_3$ some a set of parametrising constants. The metric admits
a \todoruth{is it really?}conformal transformation given by
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:cmet-transf}
  x\to pq x + n, \quad y \to pq y - n, \quad t \to p t \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  z\to p z
\end{gather}
as long as $G(x) \to q G(x)$, which imposes the following relations between the
coefficients of $G$ before (denoted by a tilde $\{\ta_i\}$) and after the
transformation:
\begin{align}
  qa_0 &= \ta_0 + \ta_1 n+ \ta_ 2 n^2 + \ta_3 n^3, \nn\\
  a_1 &= p \ta_1 + 2p\ta_2 n + 3 p\ta_3 n^2, \nn\\
  a_2 &= p^2q\ta_2 + 3 p^2q\ta_3, \nn\\
  a_3 &= p^3q^2\ta_3.
  \label{eq:cmet-transf-coefficients}
\end{align}
This symmetry allows us to remove two degrees of freedom from the initial
solution, and it is this freedom of parametrisation which has led to some
confusion as to its interpretation. The final setup that KW present involves
setting $a_1 = 0$, $a_0 = -a_2 = 1$ and then labelling $q = A^2$ and
$a_3 = -2 m A$. The final form \todoopt{add charged version here too} of the
C-metric, as written by Kinnersley and Walker is therefore given by
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:kinnersley-walker-metric}
  ds^2 = \frac{1}{A^2(x+y)^2} \left(-F(y)dt^2 + \frac{dy^2}{F(y)} +
  \frac{dx^2}{G(x)} + G(x) dz^2\right)
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  G(x) = 1-x^2-2mAx^3-e^2 A^2 x^4\qquad \mbox{and} \qquad F(y) = -G(-y).
\end{align}
This paper was published around the time Kinnersley published his doctoral
thesis, in which he also shows that the charged C-metric is simply obtained by
adding in the quartic term above, along with the potential\todoopt{find
  potential and cite - also rotating version in thesis?}. For now the parameters
$m$ and $A$ can just be interpreted as the two remaining degrees of freedom for
this solution, however it will become apparent that these can be thought of as
(being related to) the mass and the acceleration of a massive particle/black
hole respectively. The Schwarszchild and Reissner-Nordstrum spacetimes are then
recovered by first changing $y = 1/Ar$ and $t\to At$, taking the limit as
$A \to 0$ and then identifying $x = \cos\theta$ and $z = \phi$. We may also
recover the flat-space limit by setting $m=e=0$ while keeping $A>0$, and then
using the same identifications as before for $x$ and
$z$.

\placehold{Rindler Analysis, mention other work that deals with
  deficit and change to pairs of bh}

The Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski family of solutions~\cite{Plebanski:1976gy} was
published in 1976, and was described as a new class of stationary and
axisymmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ field equations which
would describe rotating, charged and accelerating black holes, and also
contain a further parameter which in certain limits was identified as the NUT
charge. \todoopt{mention Petrov type D?} The Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric is
\begin{align}
  ds^2 &= \frac{1}{(p + q)^2} \left( \frac{1+(pq)^2}{P(p)}dp^2 +
         \frac{P(p)}{1+(pq)^2}(d\sigma + q^2 d\tau)^2\right. \nn\\
       & \hspace{10em}\left.+ \frac{1+(pq)^2}{Q(q)}dq^2 - \frac{Q(q)}{1+(pq)^2}(d\tau - p^2
         d\sigma)^2\right), 
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  P &= \left(-\frac{\lambda}{6} - g_0^2 + \gamma\right) + 2np - \epsilon p^2 +
      2mp^3 + \left(-\frac{\lambda}{6}-e_0^2-\gamma)p^4\right), \nn\\
  Q &= \left(-\frac{\lambda}{6} + g_0^2 - \gamma\right) + 2np + \epsilon p^2 +
      2mp^3 + \left(-\frac{\lambda}{6}+e_0^2+\gamma)p^4\right),
\end{align}
with $\lambda$, $g_0$, $\gamma$, $n$, $\epsilon$, $m$ and $e_0$ real parameters
of the solution.\todoopt{show how one recovers C-metric and Kerr from PD}

The interpretation at this time of the metric as describing a spacetime with all
the properties above is somewhat misleading at this point, as what is really
shown in this paper is that both the C-metric, and the Kerr (rotating) and
Kerr-Newman (rotating, charged) black holes can be obtained from this metric
through various coordinate reparametrisations. \todoopt{should reorganise this
  bit}

The Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solution marks the first appearance at this point of
a rotating, or spinning C-metric. In the years that followed, various papers
appeared describing certain properties of this
geometry~\cite{Pravda:2002kj,Letelier:1998rx,Bicak:1999sa,Farhoosh:1980zz}, but
it was in 2003 that the next significant advance was made. Hong and
Teo~\cite{Hong:2003gx} realised that they could use the symmetry in
\cref{eq:cmet-transf} to re-express the metric in a way that simplified
calculations. A generic analysis of the C-metric will generically revolve around
the coordinate ranges, which are dictated by the metric functions and their root
configuration. As these are at the very least cubic functions, these roots are
described by nasty expressions and are usually left untouched. HT realised that
by re-tuning the particular set of function coefficients to those of Kinnersley
and Walker, they could express these polynomials in a factorised form with
simple roots. Using the same notation, we keep $a_0 = -a_2 = 1$ and set $a_1 =
-a_3 = 2 m A$. The C-metric in Hong-Teo form is then still given by
\cref{eq:kinnersley-walker-metric}, however the metric functions are now
\begin{align}
  G(x) = (1-x^2)(1+2mA x)\qquad \mbox{and} \qquad F(y) = -G(-y).
\end{align}
It is important to stress that the constants $m$ and $A$ used here are not the
\todoruth{I am curious, how different are they?}same as those in the KW form of the metric. To relate the two metrics, one can
simply apply the set of transformations from \cref{eq:cmet-transf}, and use the
relations in \cref{eq:cmet-transf-coefficients} between the coefficients to
find, writing KW parameters with a tilde (\~{}):\todoopt{some of the variables
  here may be confusing, $p,q,n$ are transf parameters, not sure if necess.}
\begin{align}
  q &= 1- n^2 - 2\tilde{\mu} \equiv \frac{A^2}{\tilde{A}^2}, \nn\\
  p &= q^{-\frac12}(1 + 6\tilde{\mu} n)^{-\frac12}, \nn\\
  \mu &= -p n (1-3\tilde{\mu}n) \equiv mA,
  \label{eq:cmet-KW-to-HT}
\end{align}
where $n$ is the solution to
\begin{align}
  \tilde{\mu} + n + 8\tilde{\mu}n^2 + 16\tilde{\mu}^2 n^3 = 0,
\end{align}
such that for small $\tilde{\mu}\equiv \tilde{m} \tilde{A}$ ($0\leqslant
\tilde{\mu}\leqslant3^{-3/2}$ --- will be explained at a later time but can
simply be understood as the condition which ensures $\tilde{G}(\tilde{x})$ has
multiple roots), $q$, $p$ and $\mu$ are positive. 

In this section we review the history of the C-metric and the various papers
that have contributed to its understanding and led to the metric we will be
utilising throughout this thesis.


The rough outline is this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Einstein field equations
\item Levi-Civita solution
\item Weyl Solution
\item Way later, Newman/tamburino and Robinson/Trautman put out solutions that
  revolve around this topic and include the C-metric, but no further
  understanding is provided
\item Around the same time (c. early 60s) Ehlers \& Kundt publish classification
  of solutions, among others is a class of ``C''-metrics.
\item Kinnersley and Walker (1970) revive the solution and give it its first
  interpretation as an ``accelerating'' black hole.
\item Plebanski-Demianski publish family of solutions covering all sorts of
  charges including acceleration, rotation and NUT. First mention of rotating
  accelerating black hole (There is a reference somewhere to a kinnersley paper,
  but couldn't find it in the paper...), by setting a bunch of parameters to 0
  and rescaling coordinates. referred to as ``spinning'' C-metric or
  ``SC-metric''.
\item Several papers discuss properties of SC-metric --- FZ '80, BP '99, LO '01
  and PP '02
\item Hong and Teo enter the scene and propose new form of C-metric where metric
  functions appear factorised, making certain computations involving roots
  simpler. Simple C-metric in 2003, rotating C-metric in 2005
\item Griffiths and Podolsky '05 publish neew form of PD metric and present an
  overview of the various limits of this metric.
\item Then need to look at various developments since, including further
  Hong/Teo stuff, and papers from CZ including Krtous and Podolski
\end{itemize}




\chapter{Thermodynamics of Black Holes with Conical Defects}
\label{chap:td-conical}

\todoruth[inline]{Although our understanding of the thermo has evolved, we
  present here a historical derivation of the results to indicate the key stages
  in development of understanding}

Having reviewed the fundamental concepts of black hole thermodynamics and
metrics that describe accelerated black holes, we will now present the research
that has lead to this thesis, which revolves around merging these concepts and
developing the corresponging thermodynamic quantities for accelerating black
holes. What follows is a chronological account of our findings, based mostly on
published work~\cite{Appels:2016uha,Appels:2017xoe}, though some of it remains
unpublished.

\section{Thermodynamics with Conical Deficits}\label{sec:singlemu}

Before discussing the accelerating black hole, it is interesting to revisit the
thermodynamics of a black hole with a `cosmic string': a spacetime first studied
by Aryal, Ford and Vilenkin (AFV)~\cite{Aryal:1986sz}. AFV considered a conical
deficit through a Schwarzschild black hole:
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = f(r) dt^2 - \frac{dr^2}{f(r)} - r^2 d\theta^2
- r^2 \sin^2\theta \left (\frac{d\phi}{K}\right ) ^2
\label{afv}
\end{equation}
where $f(r) = 1 -2m/r$. They considered a first law of thermodynamics to argue
that the entropy of the black hole remained at one quarter of its area, now
containing a factor of $K$: $S = \pi r_+^2/K$. The thermodynamics of a black
hole with a string was also considered in greater thoroughness by Martinez and
York \cite{Martinez:1990sd}, although the `tension' of the cosmic string,
(defined later in \eqref{afvtension}) was held fixed. The only context in which
a `varying' tension was considered was in \cite{Bonjour:1998rf}, where the
varying tension was produced by the capture of a moving cosmic string by a black
hole, and it was argued that in the collision of a black hole and cosmic string,
the black hole would retain a portion of the string thus increasing its mass.

We will revisit this static system first, as a means of exploring the impact of
varying tension on black hole thermodynamics. We will consider
a charged black hole represented by the metric \eqref{afv}, with
\begin{equation}
f(r) = 1-\frac{2m}{r} + \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}} + \frac{r^{2}}{\ell^2}\;, \qquad
\text{and} \quad {B} = - \frac{e}{r} dt\;.
\end{equation}
The parameters $m$ and $e$ are related to the black hole's mass, 
and charge respectively, $B$ is the Maxwell potential, and we allow 
for a negative cosmological constant via $\ell = \sqrt{-\Lambda/3}$.

In order to treat varying tension we leave the parameter $K$ in \eqref{afv}
unspecified.  Typically, this parameter would simply be unity (or a function of
rotation in the Kerr-AdS case), however, by keeping $K$ explicitly in the metric
we can study conical defects through a well-behaved system in a straightforward
manner.

Examining the geometry near $\theta_+ = 0$ and $\theta_- = \pi$ reveals how the
parameter $K$ relates to the conical defect. Near the poles, the metric becomes
\begin{align}
ds_{\mathrm{II}}^2 = r^2 \left[ d\vartheta^2 + \frac{\vartheta^2}{K^2} d\phi^2\right],
\end{align}
on surfaces of constant $t$ and $r$, where
$\vartheta = \pm (\theta - \theta_\pm)$ is the `distance' to either pole. If
$K\neq 1$, there will be a conical defect along the axis of revolution, which
corresponds to a cosmic string of tension
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{\delta}{8\pi} = \frac14 \bigg[1-\frac{1}{K}\bigg],
\label{afvtension}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the conical deficit. The interpretation of tension is
justified by analysing the equations of motion for an actual cosmic string
vortex in the presence of a black hole~\cite{Achucarro:1995nu}, where
\eqref{afv} was obtained as the asymptotic form of the metric outside the string
core.  A tensionless string corresponds to a regular pole, $K=1$, and in this
metric, the tension along either polar axis is equal, allowing simultaneous
regularisation of the two poles. The static black hole is inertial, as the
deficits balance each other out. This exercise provides insight into the role
$K$ plays within a metric. Different values for this parameter determine the
severity of an overall defect running through the black hole.

Now let us consider the temperature and entropy of the black hole. We compute
$T$ by demanding regularity of the Euclidean section of the black hole
\cite{Gibbons:1976ue}, giving
\begin{equation}
T = \frac{f'(r_+)}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi r_+^2} \left [
m - \frac{e^2}{r_+} + \frac{r_+^3}{\ell^2}\right]
\end{equation}
thus 
\begin{equation}
2TS = \frac{m}{K} - \frac{e}{r_+}\left (\frac{e}{K} \right ) 
+ 2\left (\frac{3}{8\pi \ell^2} \right ) \left (\frac{4\pi}{3} r_+^3\right ) 
= M - \Phi_H Q + 2PV
\end{equation}
gives a Smarr formula \cite{Smarr:1972kt} for the black hole, where $M=m/K$ is
the mass of the black hole, $Q = \frac{1}{4\pi}
\int \star dB=e/K$ is the charge on the black hole, 
$\Phi_H = e/r_+$ the potential at the horizon, and $P = 3/8\pi \ell^2$, 
$V = 4\pi r_+^3/3$ the thermodynamic pressure and volume respectively 
\cite{Teitelboim:1985dp,Kastor:2009wy,Dolan:2010ha,Cvetic:2010jb,
Dolan:2011xt,Kubiznak:2012wp,Kubiznak:2016qmn}.

Now let us consider the effect of changing the parameters of the black hole
a small amount; the location of the horizon of the black hole will also shift
so that $(f+\delta f)= 0$ at $(r_++\delta r_+) $:
\begin{equation}
0= f'(r_+) \delta r_+ - \frac{2\delta m}{r_+} 
+ \frac{2e\delta e}{r_+^2}  - 2r_+^2 \frac{\delta \ell}{\ell^3}
\label{simplevary}
\end{equation}
However, we can now replace the variation of the parameters
$m, e, \ell$ with the variation of the corresponding thermodynamic charges
$M,Q,P$, and the variation of $r_+$ with that of entropy,
with the important proviso that we must allow for the variation
of tension through $K$. Thus $\delta m = K \delta M + M \delta K$ etc.\
and $\delta K = 4K^2\delta \mu$ from \eqref{afvtension}.
After some rearrangement, \eqref{simplevary} gives our  
first law of Thermodynamics with varying tension:
\begin{equation}
\delta M = T \delta S + V \delta P + \Phi_H \delta Q
-2 \lambda \delta\mu
\label{firstlawwithK}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} 
\lambda = \left ( r_+ - KM  \right)
\label{TDlengthnoacc}
\end{equation}
is a \emph{thermodynamic length} conjugate to the string tension.

This was one of our central results -- that string tension (in this case
equal along each axis) could be thought of as analogous to a thermodynamic 
charge that therefore has a corresponding thermodynamic potential. 
Rather than write a single ``$\lambda\delta\mu$'' term, instead we write
two ``$\lambda\delta\mu$'' terms, referring to the deficits emerging from each
pole. Although these are obviously equal in this case, for 
accelerating black holes the string tensions from
each pole are not the same, and we therefore separate these out now.

Surprisingly perhaps, this thermodynamic length is not simply the 
geometric length $r_+$ of the string from pole to singularity. 
Instead, the mass-dependent adjustment
emphasises this is a potential, rather than just an internal energy
term that might more appropriately be placed on the left hand side
of the equation. 

To see why this is the case, consider the first law in action: the 
capture, and subsequent escape, of a cosmic string by a black hole. 
This example was first proposed in \cite{Bonjour:1998rf} in the
case of a charged vacuum black hole. 
The idea is that the string is moving and gets briefly captured by
the black hole. In the capture process, the internal energy of the black
hole should remain fixed: the physical intuition is that if a cosmic string
were to pass through a spherical shell of matter, energy conservation 
would demand that the spherical shell still have the same total energy
throughout the process,
thus either it would become denser, or its radius would increase.
Of course, in the case of the spherical shell, the cosmic string would simply
transit through, leaving the system. For the black hole however, we will
see this is not the case, and we have the interpretation of a segment of 
string having been captured by the black hole, with the black hole increasing
its mass accordingly. (This process was considered in the probe
limit in \cite{Lonsdale:1988xd,DeVilliers:1997nk}.)
We therefore consider the vacuum Reissner-Nordstrom (RN)
\begin{equation}
f(r) = 1  - \frac{2m}{r} + \frac{e^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}
with the charge of the black hole being defined via
$Q = e/K$, and the electric potential being
$\Phi = e/r_+$.

Let us suppose that the string is light, or $\mu \ll 1$, then in the first 
stage where the black hole captures the string, fixing $M$
and $Q$ implies $\delta m = 4 m \delta \mu$ and $\delta e = 4e\delta \mu$
(to first order in $\mu$). Thus
\begin{equation}
T \delta S = \frac{r_+-r_-}{4\pi r_+^2} \left [
2\pi r_+ \delta r_+ - 4\pi r_+^2 \delta\mu \right ]
= (r_+-r_-) \delta \mu = 2\lambda \delta \mu
\end{equation}
as required. Interestingly, because the internal energy has been fixed,
the event horizon has to move outwards to compensate for the conical 
deficit. Since the entropy contains just one factor of $K$, but two of $r_+$,
the net effect is an increase of entropy, indicating this is an irreversible
thermodynamic process. The one interesting exception being an extremal black
hole.

In the second step, the string pulls off the black hole, so $\delta \mu = -\mu$,
and since the string is uncharged, $\delta Q$ must remain zero, and $e$ 
returns to its original value. However, since entropy cannot decrease, 
$M$ must increase
\begin{equation}
\delta M = T\delta S + 2(r_+-m)\mu
= \frac{(r_+-r_-) \delta r_+}{2r_+} + 2(r_+-r_-)\mu 
\end{equation}
In \cite{Bonjour:1998rf}, we supposed that $m$ did not change, leading to an
increase in $M$ of $4m\mu$, that we incorrectly stated was the mass of the
string behind the event horizon (this is only true for the uncharged black
hole). Instead, it seems more physically accurate to suppose that $r_+$ does not
decrease, as otherwise the local geodesic congruence defining the event horizon
would appear to be contracting in contradiction to the area theorem.  In this
case, $\delta M = 2 (r_+-r_-) \mu$, or the length of cosmic string trapped
between the inner and outer horizons. Even if one allows the local horizon
radius to shrink while maintaining constant entropy,
$\delta M = (r_+ - r_-)\mu$: half the former amount, but still an increase of
mass due to the capture of a length of cosmic string.

\section{Thermodynamics of the C-metric}

We would now like to turn to the more general case where the deficits emerging
from each pole are no longer equal. The disparity in the size of the deficit
produces an overall force in the direction of the largest conical {\it deficit},
and the geometry is described by the {\it C-metric} \cite{Kinnersley:1970zw,
  Plebanski:1976gy, Dias:2002mi, Griffiths:2005qp, Podolsky:2002nk}.  Typically,
C-metrics have both black hole and acceleration horizons, however, for
simplicity we wish to restrict ourselves to having only the black hole horizon,
in order that we have a well-defined temperature for the space-time. Such a
geometry is called the {\it slowly accelerating C-metric}
\cite{Podolsky:2002nk}, and we first review this geometry before turning to its
thermodynamics.

\subsection{The Slowly Accelerating C-metric}

In this subsection we briefly review the ``slowly accelerating'' C-metric.  The
general C-metric
\cite{Kinnersley:1970zw,Plebanski:1976gy,Dias:2002mi,Griffiths:2005qp}
represents either one or two accelerating black holes with unequal conical
deficits extending from each pole of the black hole either to the boundary or an
acceleration horizon. Although the C-metric is well-known among relativists,
there are features of the specific form we will be using that are worth
highlighting, discussing how they depend on the parameters of the solution.

For this paper, we will neglect rotation, hence the general charged,
accelerating AdS black hole is represented by the metric and gauge potential
\cite{Griffiths:2005qp}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
ds^2&=\frac{1}{\Omega^2}\Biggl\{ 
f(r) dt^2
-\frac{dr^2}{f(r)} - r^2 \left[ \frac{d\theta^2}{g(\theta)} 
+ g(\theta)\sin^2\theta \frac{d\phi^2}{K^2}\right]\Biggr\}
\; , \qquad
{B}= -\frac{e}{r} dt,
\end{aligned}
\label{dimlessmtrc}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\Omega=1+A r \cos\theta\;,
\end{equation}
is the conformal factor that will determine the location of the AdS
boundary (which is {\it not} at ``$r=\infty$'') in terms of the 
$\{r,\theta\}$ coordinates, and the functions $f(r), g(\theta)$ are
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f(r)&=(1-A^2r^2)\Bigl(1-\frac{2 m}{r}+\frac{e^2}{r^2}\Bigr)
+\frac{r^2}{\ell^2} \;,\\
g(\theta)&=1+2mA \cos\theta+ e^2A^2 \cos^2\theta\,.
\end{aligned}
\label{fandg}
\end{equation}
Note we are using the Hong-Teo \cite{Hong:2003gx} style coordinates
that have a direct relation to the usual Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
for the Kerr metric.

This spacetime has potential conical singularities on the axes $\theta_+=0$
and $\theta_-=\pi$. As before, we associate these conical singularities
to cosmic strings with tensions $\mu_\pm = \delta_\pm/8\pi$, 
where $\delta_\pm$ are the conical deficit angles at each pole,
found by expanding near $\theta=\theta_\pm$:
\begin{equation}
4\mu_\pm =  1 - \frac{g(\theta_\pm)}{K}
= 1 - \frac1K \left (1 \pm 2mA + e^2A^2 \right)
\label{tensions}
\end{equation}
Clearly, $\mu_+ \leq \mu_- \leq 1/4$, and in order to avoid negative tension
defects, we require $\mu_+ \geq 0$. For the majority of the paper, 
we fix $K$ by demanding that one axis be regular ($\mu_+=0$), and the 
other to have a positive tension cosmic string, i.e.
\begin{equation}
K = g(\theta_+) = 1 + 2mA + e^2A^2\quad \Rightarrow \qquad
\mu_-= \frac{mA}{K}
\end{equation}
however in the interests of generality we will keep $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$ as
independent variables.

The metric has horizons governed by the zeros of $f(r)$,
given by rather unhelpful algebraic expressions for the roots of this
quartic. One can however see qualitatively that there are various
key limits. Looking at the large $r$ behaviour of $f$, we notice
\begin{equation}
f \sim \frac{r^2}{\ell^2} (1- A^2 \ell^2)
\end{equation}
Thus, this black hole will have an acceleration horizon if $A\ell>1$,
and no acceleration horizon if $A\ell<1$, the case $A\ell=1$ is special and
was considered in \cite{Emparan:1999wa}. 
Typically, in holographic applications, the conical deficit of the C-metric
is desired to be cloaked by a horizon \cite{Hubeny:2009kz},
however, in our case we are interested in thermodynamics, so to
keep our thermodynamic variables unambiguous, we will take 
$A\ell<1$ so that we have a single horizon, that of the black hole,
and thus a well-defined temperature corresponding to the periodicity
of Euclidean time at the regular Euclidean black hole horizon.

In order to understand the structure of this accelerating black hole, 
it is useful to consider the effects of the various parameters. 
Although we suspect $m$ and $e$ play the roles of mass and charge
for the black hole, the original form of the C-metric has these variables
defined slightly differently. In order to check this, consider the Komar 
integral for the mass using the
method described in \cite{Magnon:1985sc}
\begin{equation}
M_K = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int_{S^2} \star d\xi - \frac{1}{4\pi}
\int n_a R^a_b \xi^b \sqrt{h} d^3x = \frac{m}{K}
\label{komar}
\end{equation}
where $\xi = \partial_t$ is a timelike Killing vector field, the first integral
is performed over a $\{\theta,\phi\}$ surface of topology $S^2$ considered to be
near infinity, and the second integral is performed throughout the interior of
this surface at constant `time' (as defined by $\xi$).  Note this integral is
actually independent of $A$, hence we can associate $m$ with the bare mass of
the black hole, whether accelerating or not.  Similarly, $e$ is related to the
charge of the black hole:
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{S^2} \star dB = \frac{e}{K}
\label{Qdef}
\end{equation}

We have already seen how the parameter $K$ is related to the conical
deficits, thus the only remaining parameter to explore is $A$. In order
to understand the structure of the spacetime and the relevance of $A$,
first consider the Rindler space found by
setting $m=e=0$ in \eqref{dimlessmtrc}:
\begin{equation}
ds^2=\frac{1}{\Omega^2}\Biggl[ 
\left ( 1 + \frac{r^2}{\ell^2} (1-A^2 \ell^2) \right) dt^2
-\frac{dr^2}{1 + \frac{r^2}{\ell^2}(1-A^2\ell^2)} - r^2 \left ( d\theta^2
+ \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2\right)\Biggr]\\
\end{equation}
This spacetime no longer has a conical singularity and is locally pure AdS,
however in these coordinates the boundary of AdS is not at $r=\infty$, but at
$r = -1/(A\cos\theta)$. For $\theta$ in the southern hemisphere, this occurs at
{\it finite} $r$, but in the northern hemisphere $r=\infty$ actually lies within
the AdS spacetime (see figure \ref{fig:accbh}). To transform to global AdS
coordinates $\{R,\Theta\}$, one takes \cite{Podolsky:2002nk}
\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{R^2}{\ell^2} = \frac{1 + (1-A^2\ell^2)r^2/\ell^2}{(1-A^2\ell^2)\Omega^2}
\qquad;\qquad
R \sin\Theta = \frac{r\sin\theta}{\Omega}
\end{equation}

the boundary, $R\to\infty$ now clearly corresponds to $\Omega\to 0$, 
and the origin of Rindler coordinates corresponds to
$R_0 = A \ell^2/\sqrt{1-A^2\ell^2}$, i.e.\ the Rindler coordinates represent
those of an observer displaced from the origin of AdS.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{slowaccrind.pdf}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{accbh.pdf}
\caption{{\bf Left}: The slowly accelerating Rindler spacetime shown here with
  $A\ell = 1/4$, and $\ell=1$ for simplicity. The spatial sections of AdS have
  been compactified to a Poincar\'e disc, with the constant $r$ Rindler
  coordinate indicated in black and constant $\theta$ in blue. The origin of the
  Rindler coordinates is clearly visible as being displaced from the centre of
  the disc, with the limit of the $r-$coordinate being the thick dashed black
  line.  {\bf Right}: The black hole distorts the Poincar\'e disc with a conical
  deficit, and is displaced from the origin of AdS. The spacetime is again
  static, and a cross section is shown. }
\label{fig:accbh}
\end{figure}
A comprehensive exploration of the structure of AdS C-metric spacetimes, 
including their distortion of the boundary, was given in \cite{Krtous:2005ej}.

\subsection{Thermodynamics of the Slowly Accelerating C-metric}

In this section we perform a similar analysis to that of the string threading the 
black hole, but now we must allow for the tension of each of the conical deficits
of the C-metric to vary.
We start by finding the temperature and entropy of the black hole, using
the conventional relations
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T &= \frac{f'(r_+)}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi r_+^2} \left [ (1-A^2 r_+^2) \left (
m - \frac{e^2}{r_+}\right) + \frac{r_+^3}{\ell^2(1-A^2 r_+^2)} \right]\\
S &= \frac{\rm Area}{4} =\frac{\pi r_+^2}{K(1-A^2 r_+^2)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
checking the Smarr relation, we compute
\begin{equation}
2TS =\frac{m}{K} - \frac{e^2}{K r_+^2}
+ \frac{r_+^3}{K\ell^2(1-A^2 r_+^2)^2} 
\end{equation}
The charge of the black hole is given by \eqref{Qdef}, $Q = e/K$, and defining 
\begin{equation}
V  = \frac{4\pi r_+^3}{3K(1-A^2r_+^2)^2}
\end{equation}
as the modified thermodynamic volume, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\frac{m}{K} = 2 TS  + Q\Phi_H - 2 PV\,.
\end{equation}
Although it is tempting to identify $M=m/K$, this would be to ignore the
asymptotics of the spacetime. The experience of the rotating AdS black hole
\cite{Gibbons:2004ai} is that thermodynamic potentials should be normalised at
infinity, and in the case of rotation, the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates give a
boundary that is rotating. Subtracting off this rotation leads to an extra
renormalisation of the thermodynamic mass, a correct Smarr formula and correct
first law.

Here, however, we cannot simply perform a similar electromagnetic
gauge transformation. Our electrostatic potential no longer
vanishes at infinity, and our boundary has an electric flux from pole to pole
\begin{equation}
F = eA \sin\theta \, dt \wedge d\theta
\end{equation}
We obviously cannot subtract this charge, as that would be a physical change,
but it does lead us to suspect that there may be a renormalization of
electrostatic potential and thermodynamic mass. We will show how to do this
presently, but first consider just the uncharged black hole, and consider
variations in the position of the horizon as in \eqref{simplevary}:
\begin{equation}
\delta f(r_+) = f_+' \delta r_+  - 2 \frac{\delta m}{r_+} (1-A^2r_+^2)
- 2 A \delta A r_+ (r_+ - 2m) - 2 \frac{r_+^2}{\ell^3} \delta \ell = 0
\end{equation}
The procedure is similar to the previous section, but we now have
more algebra involved in the variation of the thermodynamic parameters.
For example, in relating $\delta r_+$ to $\delta S$, we have:
\begin{equation}
\delta S = \frac{2\pi r_+ \delta r_+}{K(1-A^2 r_+^2)^2} + 
\frac{2 \pi r_+^4 A\delta A}{K (1-A^2 r_+^2)^2} - 
\frac{\pi r_+^2}{(1-A^2 r_+^2)} \frac{\delta K}{K^2}
\end{equation}
where our expressions for the tensions \eqref{tensions} give
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta K}{K^2} = 2 \left ( \delta \mu_+ + \delta \mu_- \right )
\quad ; \qquad \frac{m}{K} \delta A = - \left [
\delta \mu_+ - \delta \mu_- + A \delta (\frac{m}{K}) \right]\,.
\end{equation}
Defining $M=m/K$, after some algebra one gets
\begin{equation}
\delta M = V\delta P + T \delta S -
\delta \mu_+ \left [ \frac{r_+}{1+Ar_+} - KM \right ] -
\delta \mu_- \left [ \frac{r_+}{1-Ar_+} - KM \right ] \,.
\label{firstaccm}
\end{equation}
Thus, the accelerating black hole has the same thermodynamic first law
as the non-accelerating black hole, but now with a thermodynamic length
for the piece of string attaching at each pole:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\pm = \frac{r_+}{1 \pm Ar_+} - KM
\end{equation}
This obviously agrees with \eqref{TDlengthnoacc} for the string
threading the black hole, where $r_+$ has now been replaced by
$r_+/\Omega(r_+,\theta_\pm)$ at each pole.

Now let us consider the addition of charge. Following the same procedure of
varying the horizon as before leads to the relation
\begin{equation}
\delta (\frac{m}{K}) = T \delta S + V \delta P + \Phi_H\delta Q
- \frac{r_+\delta \mu_+}{1+Ar_+}- \frac{r_+\delta \mu_-}{1-Ar_+}
+ \frac{m\delta K}{2K^2}
\end{equation}
where now our expressions for the tensions lead to
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{m}{K} \delta A &= -\delta \mu_+ + \delta \mu_- 
- A \delta \left (\frac{m}{K} \right) \\
[1 - e^2 A^2 ] \frac{\delta K}{2K^2} &= A^2 e \delta Q
- \frac{e^2 A^2}{m} \delta \left ( \frac{m}{K} \right )
+ \delta \mu_+ \left [ 1 - \frac{Ae^2}{m} \right ] + \delta \mu_- \left [ 1 + \frac{Ae^2}{m} \right ]
\end{aligned}
\label{deltaKcharge}
\end{equation}

Keeping an open mind, we define our thermodynamic mass and electrostatic
potential as:
\begin{equation}
M = \gamma(e,A) \frac{m}{K} \quad ; \qquad
\Phi = \Phi_H - \Phi_0
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_0$ is a correction, re-zeroing the potential, analogous to the
correction of the angular potential of the Kerr-AdS black hole, but without the
corresponding interpretation of being the value of the original potential at
infinity.

Next, we compare
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\delta M &= \gamma \delta \left ( \frac{m}{K} \right ) 
+ \frac{m}{K} (\gamma_e \delta e + \gamma_A \delta A)
\\&= \gamma \delta \left ( \frac{m}{K} \right ) 
+ m \gamma_e \delta Q + m e \gamma_e \frac{\delta K}{K^2}
+ \gamma_A \frac{m}{K} \delta A
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
to
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T \delta S + V \delta P + \Phi \delta Q -\lambda_+ \delta \mu_+ - \lambda_-\delta \mu_-
= \delta \left ( \frac{m}{K} \right ) 
- \Phi_0 \delta Q - \frac{m\delta K}{2K^2}&\\
+ \left [ \frac{r_+}{1+Ar_+} - \lambda _+ \right]\delta \mu_+
+ \left [ \frac{r_+}{1-Ar_+} - \lambda _- \right]\delta \mu_-&
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_\pm$ are to be determined. After some
algebra, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\delta M &- T \delta S - V \delta P - \Phi \delta Q 
+ \lambda_+ \delta \mu_+ + \lambda_-\delta \mu_-\\
&=
\left [ (1-e^2 A^2) \gamma-2 e^3A^2 \gamma_e - A(1-e^2 A^2) \gamma_A -1 \right] 
 \frac{ \delta \left ( {m/K} \right ) }{(1-e^2A^2)}  \\
&+ \left [ m (1+e^2 A^2) \gamma_e + mA^2 e
+(1-e^2 A^2) \Phi_0 \right] \frac{ \delta Q }{(1-e^2A^2) }\\
&+ \left [ \lambda_+ - \frac{r_+}{1+Ar_+} - \gamma_A 
+ \frac{(2e\gamma_e+1)}{1-e^2 A^2} \left ( m - e^2A \right) 
\right] \delta \mu_+\\
&+ \left [ \lambda_- - \frac{r_+}{1-Ar_+} + \gamma_A 
+\frac{(2e\gamma_e+1)}{1-e^2 A^2} \left ( m + e^2A \right) 
\right] \delta \mu_-
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
for our first law to hold, clearly the RHS of this equation must vanish, leading
to a constraint for $\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
(1-e^2 A^2) \gamma-2 e^3A^2 \gamma_e - A(1-e^2 A^2) \gamma_A =1
\quad \Rightarrow \qquad \gamma = \frac{1}{1+e^2 A^2}
\end{equation}
thus specifying our thermodynamic mass
and determining $\Phi_0$ and $\lambda_\pm$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
M &= \frac{m}{K(1+e^2 A^2)} \\
\Phi_0 &= \frac{meA^2}{1+e^2 A^2}\\
\lambda_\pm &= \frac{r_+}{1\pm Ar_+} - \frac{m(1-e^2A^2)}{(1+e^2 A^2)^2} 
\mp \frac{e^2A}{(1+e^2 A^2)}
\end{aligned}
\label{TDparams}
\end{equation}
This is a rather unusual set of relations, the off-set of the electrostatic
potential depends on mass, and the thermodynamic mass depends on charge. We view
this as a consequence of the fact that for the accelerating black hole, the
electric potential cannot be gauged away at infinity -- there is a polar
electric field at the AdS boundary, thus mass and charge are inextricably
intertwined.

\section{The Thermodynamic Length}

To recap, we have shown that allowing for a varying conical deficit
in black hole spacetimes, the first law of thermodynamics becomes
\begin{equation}
\delta M = T \delta S + V\delta P + \Phi \delta Q - \lambda_+ \delta \mu_+
- \lambda_- \delta \mu_-
\end{equation}
where the relevant thermodynamical variables are given in \eqref{TDparams}.
In order to accommodate varying 
tension, we have to define a {\it thermodynamic length},
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\pm = \frac{r_+}{1\pm Ar_+} - \frac{m(1-e^2A^2)}{(1+e^2 A^2)^2} 
\mp \frac{e^2A}{(1+e^2 A^2)}
\end{equation}
for each conical deficit emerging from each pole. This length consists of 
a direct geometrical part, a mass dependent correction, and finally, a shift
in the presence of charge.

It is interesting to compare this mass-dependent shift of the thermodynamic
length to the correction of the thermodynamic volume for a rotating black
hole \cite{Cvetic:2010jb,Dolan:2011jm}:
\begin{equation}
V = \frac{4\pi}{3} \left \{ \frac{r_+(r_+^2+a^2)}{K} + a^2 M \right\}
\end{equation}
In this case, the first term is the expected geometric volume of the 
interior of the black hole, the second term being a rotation dependent
correction. With this appropriately shifted thermodynamic volume,
the black hole always satisfies a {\it Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality}
\cite{Cvetic:2010jb}, that is to say, the entropy of a black hole of a given
thermodynamic volume is always maximised for the purely spherical
(Schwarzschild) black hole. (We verified in \cite{Appels:2016uha} that
the accelerating black hole satisfies the reverse isoperimetric inequality;
allowing tension to vary does not alter this result.)

Notice that the correction term for this thermodynamic volume is
always positive, whereas the correction term for thermodynamic 
length is actually negative.
This means that for large enough mass, the thermodynamic length
itself becomes negative, as shown in figure \ref{fig:TDlength} for 
an uncharged black hole. The picture for a charged black hole is 
similar, although the critical value of $M$ for which $\lambda_-$ 
becomes negative is larger.
\begin{figure}
\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{TDlength.pdf}}
\caption{A plot of thermodynamic length of the south pole tension for regular
north pole, $\mu_+=0$. The limit of the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole is shown
in pink ($\mu_-=0$). The slowly accelerating r\'egime, $A\ell<1$, is shown as a 
solid line, and $A\ell>1$ is shown dashed. 
}
\label{fig:TDlength}
\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:TDlength}, we see that the thermodynamic length becomes
negative for `large' black holes, i.e.\ those for which the thermodynamic mass
is of similar order (or higher) than the AdS scale. Setting this in the context
of the `cosmic string' capture process considered in section \ref{sec:singlemu}
for the vacuum black hole, this would mean that the thermodynamic mass must
increase during a capture, as entropy cannot decrease. This seems at first
counter to the notion that the string itself does not carry `ADM' mass, however,
the heuristic argument of section \ref{sec:singlemu} relies somewhat on the
notion that a cosmic string and black hole can be sufficiently separated so that
one can consider their thermodynamical (and other) properties independently. For
large black holes in AdS this is manifestly not the case.

It is also interesting to compare these results for varying tension to our
previous work \cite{Appels:2016uha}, where $K$ and $\mu_\pm$ were held fixed.
With these assumptions, $eA$ and $mA$ were fixed, however, we did not alter the
thermodynamic mass from $m/K$, nor the electrostatic potential from
$\Phi_H$. The two sets of results are consistent, since
\begin{equation}
\Phi_0 Q = \frac{m e^2 A^2}{K(1+e^2 A^2)} 
= \frac{m}{K} \left [ 1 - \frac{1}{1+e^2 A^2} \right] = \frac{m}{K} - M
\end{equation}
The shift in electrostatic potential multiplied by charge therefore balances the
shift in thermodynamic mass in both the Smarr formula, and indeed the first law
with the assumptions made in \cite{Appels:2016uha} since $eA$ was required to be
fixed. However, it is worth revisiting these assumptions in the light of our
work here on varying tension.

First, notice that our charged C-metric has parameters: $m$, relating to the
mass of the black hole, $e$ to its charge, $A$ to its acceleration, and $K$,
that relates to an overall conical deficit. $K$ is the one parameter that has no
immediately obvious physical interpretation, indeed seems more like a coordinate
choice, thus fixing $K$ was natural. However, now armed with our better
understanding of the metric and its thermodynamics, we see that in fixing the
tensions of the deficits, we are fixing two physical quantities, thus we should
only find that {\it two} combinations of the solution parameters are
fixed. Therefore, we should not fix $K$ a priori, but instead just the
combinations of parameters that fix the tensions:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
2(\mu_++\mu_-) &= 1 - \frac{1+e^2A^2}{K} \\
\mu_+ - \mu_- &= - \frac{mA}{K}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
From these expressions, we see that if charge vanishes, then indeed fixing
tensions fixes $K$ and the combination $mA$, but if charge does not vanish, then
we can no longer conclude that $\delta K=0$. Instead
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\delta K}{K} = \frac{\delta (mA)}{mA} = 2\frac{eA\delta (eA)}{1+e^2A^2}
\end{equation}
i.e.\ we have {\it two} constraints on the variation of our parameters.  Thus,
for example if we throw a small mass $m_0$ into the black hole, we expect
$\delta M = m_0$, $\delta Q=\delta P = 0$. Using the expression for $M$ and the
tensions we then find:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\delta K}{K^2} &= - 2 \frac{e^2 A^2}{m}\delta M &
\delta A &= - (1-e^2 A^2) \frac{AK}{m} \delta M\\
\delta m &= (1- 3 e^2 A^2) K \delta M&
\delta e &= -2\frac{e^3A^2K}{m} \delta M
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
indicating that the acceleration of the black hole drops, as expected.

\section{Critical Behaviour of Accelerating Black Holes}

Given that we are working in anti-de Sitter spacetime, we can ask whether there
is something analogous to a Hawking-Page phase transition \cite{Hawking:1982dh}
for our accelerating black holes, although it is difficult to see how one could
actually have a phase transition between a system with a conical deficit along
one polar axis only, and a presumably totally regular radiation bath.  However,
recall that a black hole in AdS behaves similarly to a black hole in a
reflecting box, with the negative curvature of the AdS providing the qualitative
reflection. For small black holes, the effect of the negative curvature is
sub-dominant to the local curvature of the black hole, and the black hole has
negative specific heat, as in the vacuum Schwarzschild case. For black holes
larger than the AdS radius, the vacuum curvature dominates, and the black hole
has positive specific heat, in particular, there is a minimum temperature for a
black hole in AdS, below this temperature, only a radiation bath can be a
solution to the Einstein equations at finite $T$. Plotting the Gibbs free energy
as a function of temperature shows both the allowed states, as well as the
preferred one for a given temperature.  At very low $T$, the only allowed state
is a radiation bath. Above a critical temperature $T_c = \sqrt{3}/2\pi\ell$, one
can have either a radiation bath, or a black hole (that may be either `small' or
`large'). However for $T>1/\pi\ell$, the large black hole is not only
thermodynamically stable (in the sense of positive specific heat) but
thermodynamically preferred, and a radiation bath will spontaneously transition
into a large black hole.

First consider the situation where our accelerating black hole is
uncharged.\footnote{ Note: in all explicit examples and figures in this section
  we take the $\theta=0$ axis to be regular ($\mu_+=0$). This is for simplicity,
  including a nonzero north pole tension does not alter the essential physics of
  what we present here.}  Fixing the tension of the string, we can plot the
temperature of our black hole as a function of its mass, $M$, as shown in figure
\ref{fig:TvMnocharge}.  This figure shows how increasing acceleration actually
makes a black hole of given mass {\it more} thermodynamically stable in the
sense of positive specific heat. Figure \ref{fig:TvMnocharge} also shows the
corresponding Gibbs free energy, indicating the would-be Hawking-Page transition
occurs at lower temperatures as acceleration increases.
\begin{figure}
\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.58]{TvMnocharge.pdf}~
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{GvMnocharge.pdf}}
\caption{{\bf Left:} A plot of temperature as a function of mass (in units of
  $\ell$) for the uncharged black hole.  The slowly accelerating r\'egime is
  shown as a solid line, and the inferred local horizon temperature for
  $A\ell>1$ is shown dashed. Note how for larger string tension (hence greater
  acceleration) the region of positive specific heat increases. {\bf Right:} A
  similar plot, but now showing the Gibbs free energy as a function of
  temperature.  }
\label{fig:TvMnocharge}
\end{figure}

At first sight, this is rather curious, as a naive examination of the uncharged
C-metric shows that the Newtonian potential, $f(r)$ has the cosmological
constant ameliorated by the acceleration:
$f(r) = r^2 (1 / \ell^2 - A^2) \simeq r^2/\ell_{\rm eff}^2$. Given that one
often imagines that it is the black hole radius relative to the confining `box'
of AdS that is causing the thermodynamic stability of the large black holes,
this looks rather confusing: increasing acceleration appears to counteract the
AdS length scale. However, this intuition is too naive: the relevant effect is
the spacetime curvature in the vicinity of the horizon, and whether the black
hole or the cosmological constant is dominant (larger black holes having smaller
tidal forces). Computing the Kretschmann scalar at the event horizon
demonstrates that indeed, increasing acceleration for a given mass lowers the
local tidal forces due to the black hole.  In fact, it is easy to compute the
``Hawking-Page'' transition temperature, assuming the radiation bath to have
zero Gibbs energy from the expressions for $TS$ and $M$ in terms of $r_+$, $A$
and $\ell$. A brief calculation gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
T_{HP} (r_+, \ell, A) &= \frac{1}{4\pi r_+ }\left [
\frac{ 3r_+^2}{\ell^2 ( 1- A^2 r_+^2) } + 1 \right ]\\
& \simeq \frac{1}{2\pi \ell} \left ( 1 - \frac32 A^2 \ell^2 + {\cal{O}} (A^4 \ell^4) \right)
\;.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
While the acceleration parameter $A$ is not a thermodynamic charge, instead
being related to the tension via $M$, nonetheless, the general picture is that
increasing tension increases acceleration, thereby decreasing the temperature at
which the ``Hawking-Page'' transition occurs.

Now consider adding a charge to the black hole, for which we might now expect a
richer phase structure, possibly with critical phenomena analogous to the
isolated charged AdS black hole
\cite{Chamblin:1999tk,Cvetic:1999ne,Chamblin:1999hg}. The critical phenomena
occur due to the three possible phases of black hole behaviour for varying mass.
In the presence of charge, there is now a lower limit on the mass parameter of
the black hole, set by the extremal limit where the temperature vanishes.
Increasing the mass of the black hole moves it away from extremality, thus
increasing temperature, rendering the specific heat positive near this lower
limit. For large mass black holes, we are also in a positive specific heat
r\'egime where the local vacuum curvature is dominant in the near horizon
geometry.  Depending on the size of the charge relative to the vacuum energy,
there can be an additional negative specific heat r\'egime where the black hole
is small enough that its local curvature is dominant, but is far enough from
extremality that the usual Schwarzschild negative specific heat type of
behaviour pervades.  Given that for uncharged accelerating black holes,
increasing tension lowers the critical temperature at which the transition to
positive specific heat occurs, we expect this `swallowtail' behaviour to be
mitigated for charged accelerating black holes in the canonical ensemble, and
indeed this is what is observed.
\begin{figure}
\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{TvMcharge.pdf}}
\caption{A plot of temperature as a function of mass for the charged black hole,
  with fixed $Q=0.05\ell$, and varying tension as labelled. As before, the
  slowly accelerating r\'egime is shown as a solid line, and $A\ell>1$ is shown
  dashed.  }
\label{fig:TvMcharge}
\end{figure}

We first explore the accelerating black hole in the canonical ensemble, i.e.\
where the charge, $Q$, of the black hole is fixed, but we allow $M$ and $\mu_-$
to vary.  In figure \ref{fig:TvMcharge}, we give a representative plot of
temperature as a function of black hole mass for $Q=0.05\ell$ to illustrate how
increasing tension gradually removes the negative specific heat phase of the
black hole.
\begin{figure}
\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.58]{GvTvarymu.pdf}~
\includegraphics[scale=0.58]{GvTvaryQ.pdf}}
\caption{A plot of the free energy as a function of temperature for varying
  tension with $Q=0.05\ell$ on the left, and varying charge with $4\mu_-=0.3$ on
  the right.  }
\label{fig:GvTcharge}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:GvTcharge} shows the variation of the free energy $F=M-TS$ with
temperature for varying tension and charge. As tension is increased, the
swallowtail becomes smaller, and eventually disappears, analogous to the
situation where the charge is gradually increased, shown on the right in figure
\ref{fig:GvTcharge}. The free energy plot tells us that at low temperatures, we
have the near extremal black hole, however as the mass of the black hole
increases there is a critical value at which there is a spontaneous transition
to a larger black hole with positive specific heat. The existence of this
transition relies on the presence of the intermediate region of negative
specific heat for the charged black hole.  For large enough tension (or charge
relative to $\ell$), there is a critical point at which this intermediate
r\'egime disappears, and the phase transition along with it.  Figure
\ref{fig:coexist} shows the ``van der Waals'' like behaviour of this coexistence
curve for varying tension (in analogy to the varying potential plots of
\cite{Chamblin:1999tk}), and cosmological constant (in analogy to
\cite{Kubiznak:2012wp}).
\begin{figure}
\center{\includegraphics[scale=0.59]{coexistvarymu.pdf}~
\includegraphics[scale=0.57]{coexistvaryell.pdf}}
\caption{The coexistence line for the charged black hole shown for varying
  tension and cosmological constant with the black hole charge is fixed at

  point is $\mu_c = 0.219$. On the right, $4\mu_- = 0.3$, and the critical value
  of the AdS radius is $\ell_c = 0.36$.}
\label{fig:coexist}
\end{figure}

Finally, for completeness we consider the thermodynamics of the accelerating
charged black hole in the grand canonical ensemble, where we now allow charge to
vary. The Gibbs potential is now $G=M-TS-Q\Phi$, with
\begin{equation}
\Phi = \Phi_H - \Phi_0
= \frac{e}{r_+} - \frac{meA^2}{1+e^2A^2} 
\label{grandcanphi}
\end{equation}
kept fixed. The interesting feature of fixed potential, as noted in
\cite{Chamblin:1999tk} for an isolated RNAdS black hole, is that there is a
critical value of $\Phi$ delineating two qualitatively different behaviours of
the black hole.  For small fixed potentials, the charged AdS black hole can
never approach extremality. This can be seen by noting that $f=f'=0$ at
extremality, where $f(r)$ is the RNAdS black hole potential. Solving these
algebraic equations, and substituting $\Phi_{RN} = e/r_+$, one finds the
constraint $3r_+^2 /\ell^2= \Phi_{RN}^2-1$, thus for $|\Phi_{RN}|<1$ there is no
possibility of extremality. In our case, for the charged accelerating black
hole, the algebraic relations for extremality at fixed potential are
considerably more complicated partly due to the extra acceleration parameter,
but mostly because of the complicated expression for $\Phi$
\eqref{grandcanphi}. However, the same principle applies, and we also observe a
similar phase transition from small to large $\Phi$, where the critical value of
$\Phi$ is now tension dependent. Figure \ref{fig:grand} demonstrates this
behaviour showing the analogous plot to \cite{Chamblin:1999tk} with acceleration
for fixed $\mu_-$, and also how the behaviour depends on $\mu_-$ at fixed
$\Phi$, illustrating how increasing $\mu_-$ improves the thermodynamic viability
of the black hole.  Figure \ref{fig:phicrit} shows how the critical value of the
potential, where only positive specific heat black holes are allowed, varies
with tension.

\section{Conclusion}

To sum up: we have shown how to allow for a varying conical deficit
in black hole spacetimes, and found the relevant thermodynamical 
variables to describe the system. The appropriate first law has a 
varying tension term, with a thermodynamic length as its potential. 
This length consists of a direct geometrical part, a mass dependent correction, 
and finally, a shift in the presence of charge. The thermodynamic phases of
accelerating black holes exhibit similar behaviour to their non-accelerating 
AdS cousins, however, the impact of acceleration is to improve the thermodynamic
stability of the black holes.

It is interesting to note that the first law indicates that if the tension of a
defect is fixed, then there is no contribution to the variation of $M$ coming
from tension, yet, if the black hole increases its mass and hence its horizon
radius, the horizon will now have consumed a portion of the string along each
pole.  This does not appear in the thermodynamic relation. This reinforces the
interpretation of $M$ as the {\it enthalpy} of the black hole
\cite{Kastor:2009wy}.  Although the black hole increases its internal energy by
swallowing some cosmic string, it has also displaced the exact same amount of
energy from the environment, resulting in no net overall gain in the total
energy of the thermodynamic system (other than the mass that was added to the
black hole in the first place).

It would be interesting to consider whether there are any holographic
applications for these solutions. Typically, one avoids having such distorted
boundaries, however, the fact that the thermodynamics of these systems is now
well defined perhaps suggests this is worth a second look.

Finally, we have not discussed rotating accelerating black holes here. Even for
the non-accelerating rotating black hole, the thermodynamics are more subtle,
requiring an adjustment of the angular velocity \cite{Gibbons:2004ai} in order
to define it relative to a non-rotating frame at infinity. For a conical defect
running through the black hole (though see
\cite{Gregory:2013xca,Gregory:2014uca} for a full discussion of subtleties of
replacing deficits by finite width defects) one can follow the method of section
\ref{sec:singlemu} to generalise the appropriate thermodynamical variables of
Gibbons et al.\ \cite{Gibbons:2004ai} to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
M &= \frac{m}{KL} \;\;\;; \;\;\;\;&
V &= \frac{4\pi}{3} \left [ \frac{r_+(r_+^2+a^2)}{K} + a^2 M \right]\\
J &= \frac{am}{K^2} \;\;\;; \;\;\;\;&
\Omega &= \Omega_H-\Omega_\infty
= \frac{aK}{r_+^2+a^2} + \frac{aK}{\ell^2 L} \;\;\;; \;\;\;\;\\
Q &= \frac{e}{K} \;\;\;;\;\;\;\;& \Phi &= \frac{er_+}{r_+^2+a^2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the (arbitrary) parameter determining the periodicity of the
azimuthal angle as before, and $L$ is a new parameter due to black hole
rotation:
\begin{equation}
L = 1 - \frac{a^2}{\ell^2}
\end{equation}
In \cite{Gibbons:2004ai}, $K=L$ was mandated by having no conical deficit on the
rotation axis, however, here we are being more general. Allowing the tension of
any deficit to vary leads to the thermodynamic length:
\begin{equation}
\lambda = \left ( r_+ - KM \frac{1+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}}{1-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}} \right)
= \left ( r_+ - \frac{KM}{L}(2-L) \right)
\end{equation}
Thus our black hole obeys a standard first law, 
\begin{equation}
\delta M = T \delta S + V \delta P + \Omega \delta J + \Phi \delta Q
-2 \lambda \delta\mu
\end{equation}
as well as a conventional Smarr relation:
\begin{equation}
M
= 2TS + \Phi Q - 2 PV + 2 \Omega J
\end{equation}

Once the black hole is accelerating, it is no longer possible to have a
completely non-rotating frame at infinity due to the distortion of the
boundary. The potential therefore has a more complicated adjustment involving
not only a shift, but also a decision on which is the appropriate frame to use
at infinity. Computing the relevant parameters for the rotating accelerating
black hole is underway.

\chapter{Critical Black Holes with Teardrop-Shaped Horizons}
\label{chap:crit-bh}

In exploring possible black hole solutions in four-dimensional Fayet-Iliopoulos
gauged supergravities, Gnecchi et al.~\cite{Gnecchi:2013mja} briefly presented a
non-compact black hole horizon with a finite area. It was later clarified in a
letter by Klemm~\cite{Klemm:2014rda} that this solution can be interpreted as
the \emph{ultra-spinning} limit of the Kerr-AdS solution, where the rotation
parameter is taken to be critically large. This limit only becomes sensible if
one admits the existence of conical defects running along the main axis of
revolution, which in turn become maximal in this limit. The result is a horizon
which could be described as roughly spherical near its equator, with sharp
conical deficits at each pole that extrude to the boundary.

From here, in a series of papers, DK, in Hennigar et
al.~\cite{Hennigar:2015gan,Hennigar:2014cfa,Hennigar:2015cja}\todoopt{not sure
how to word this}, explored the thermodynamic implications of having such an
extraordinary spacetime. If the non-diverging area of a non-compact horizon was
the initial ``first of its kind'' for this solution, these papers established
the second such instance. The \emph{reverse isoperimetric
conjecture}~\cite{Dolan:2013ft,Cvetic:2010jb} establishes an upper bound on the
entropy for any black hole given its thermodynamic volume, which is reached only
for spherical black hole solutions. The ultraspinning black hole was the first
solution found to violate this conjecture, leading the authors to impose more
stringent conditions under which the bound might be valid.

In this paper, we seek to determine the uniqueness of this latter discovery. A
curious feature of the ultraspinning spacetime is that it is seemingly isolated
from regularly-spinning black holes by any physical process. It is interesting
therefore to ponder whether it truly is a special case, or whether this
violation is present in further extensions of this solution. One way in which
the set of black hole solutions can be extended beyond the usual generalisations
to charged and/or rotating solutions is to consider acceleration.

The solution that describes the accelerated black hole is known as the
C-metric\todoopt{citations}. It is similar in form to Kerr-AdS,
but is differentiated by a non-removable conical defect and a boundary offset
from the usual $r\to\infty$, if one treats $r$ as a generic radial
coordinate. The characteristic feature of the ultra-spinning black hole is the
pair of maximal deficits at each pole. The accelerated solution has by default
one deficit greater than the other, which means that we may only have one such
maximal defect. The term ``ultra-spinning'' to designate this class of solutions
in the context of acceleration is misleading, for unlike inertial black holes,
this state may be reached by maximising---more appropriately, as will be
explained in further sections, extremising---not only rotation but either
acceleration or even charge as well. The term \emph{critical}, for lack of an
original word will therefore be used to designate any black hole solution which
exhibits a single (or a pair of) $2\pi$-deficit(s).

In the context of thermodynamics, we observe these accelerated critical
solutions to behave differently to the original ultra-spinning black hole. The
thermodynamic properties of Kerr-AdS solutions have been known for a
while~\cite{Gibbons:2004ai, Silva:2002jq, Caldarelli:1999xj, Hawking:1998kw,
  Kostelecky:1995ei, Hawking:1982dh} and in the ultra-spinning limit must be
redefined to avoid diverging quantities. On the contrary, we find that when
accelerated black holes are critical, no such redefinition is required. The
thermodynamics of accelerated black holes~\cite{Appels:2017xoe,Appels:2016uha}
hold and as was confirmed in our previous work, the reverse isoperimetric
conjecture too holds.

\subsection{Review of the ultra-spinning black hole}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{embed3Dus-noA-tilted}
  \caption{\label{fig:embed3Dus-noA-tilted}A $\theta$--$\phi$ slice of the
    ultra-spinning black hole spacetime for $r=r_+$, the outer horizon.}
\end{figure}

We begin by considering the rotating black hole in asymptotically AdS space,
described by the Kerr-AdS metric. In Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, it is, 
\begin{align} \label{eq:KerrAdS}
ds^2 = -\frac{f(r)}{\Sigma}\Big[dt-a\sin^2\theta \frac{d\phi}{K} \Big]^2 +
  \frac{\Sigma}{f(r)}dr^2 + \frac{\Sigma r^2}{g(\theta)}d\theta^2 +
  \frac{g(\theta) \sin^2\theta}{\Sigma r^2} \Big[adt-(r^2+a^2)
  \frac{d\phi}{K}\Big]^2, 
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
f(r)&= 1-\frac{2 m}{r}+\frac{a^2}{r^2}+\frac{r^2+a^2}{\ell^2},\nn\\
g(\theta)&=1 - \frac{a^2}{\ell^2} \cos^2\theta, \nn\\
\Sigma(r, \theta) &= 1 + \frac{a^2}{r^2} \cos^2\theta,
\end{align}
and $K$ is a parameter which we choose to leave unspecified. The parameters $m$
and $a$ correspond to the mass and rotation of the spacetime and
$\ell = \sqrt{-3/\Lambda}$ is the AdS length scale. The Kerr-AdS metric is
usually written with $K = L = 1-a^2/\ell^2$ which ensures the poles are
regular. Indeed, one may check that with $K$ undefined, this spacetime has a
conical deficit given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:deficit-al}
\delta = 2\pi \bigg[1-\frac{1-a^{2}/\ell^{2}}{K}\bigg].
\end{align}

The ultra-spinning limit is obtained by taking the limit in which
$a\to\ell$. From the expression above, it is clear that in this limit the
deficit along the $\theta = 0$ and $\theta=\pi$ axes is maximal ($2\pi$). The
$\phi\phi$-component of the traditional metric, with regular poles, diverges,
and the workaround presented in~\cite{Hennigar:2014cfa} amounts to having
$K\neq L$. Part of the reasoning behind naming this spacetime as ultra-spinning
is that the angular velocity evaluted on the boundary of the spacetime also
diverges, despite the adjusted metric. \Cref{fig:embed3Dus-noA-tilted} shows an
embedding of this spacetime.

\section{The rotating C-metric}
The gravitational solution that describes an accelerating black hole is known as
the C-metric\todoopt{cites}. We begin by introducing the generalised
asymptotically AdS C-metric solution as derived from the Pleba\' nski--Demia\'
nski \cite{Plebanski:1976gy} metric to include rotation and charge, and the
corresponding gauge potential,
\begin{align}
  ds^2 &= \frac{1}{\Omega^2}\bigg\{ -\frac{f(r)}{\Sigma}\Big[dt - a\sin^2\theta
         \frac{d\phi}{K} \Big]^2 + \frac{\Sigma}{f(r)}dr^2 + \frac{\Sigma
         r^2}{g(\theta)}d\theta^2 \nn\\
  &\hspace{20em} + \frac{g(\theta) \sin^2\theta}{\Sigma r^2} \Big[adt-(r^2+a^2)
    \frac{d\phi}{K}\Big]^2\bigg\},\nn\\ 
  F&=dB,\qquad B=-\frac{e}{\Sigma r}\Big[dt-a\sin^2\theta \frac{d\phi}{K}\Big].
\label{eq:metric}
\end{align}
\todoopt{Discuss more about the origin of the C-metric and its
  significance. Also write about the origin of this form, PB/RT and hong teo.} 
Ordinarily, when discussing the C-metric, the azimuthal angular coordinate
$\phi$ is given an arbitrary periodicity, usually determined such that one pole
is regularised. In \cref{eq:metric}, $\phi$ has a $2\pi$-periodicity
and any conical defect is tuned through the parameter $K$. The conformal
factor
\begin{align}\label{eq:conf}
\Omega=1+Ar\cos\theta
\end{align}
sets the location of the boundary at $r_\bd=-1/A\cos\theta$. The other metric
functions are given as
\begin{gather}
f(r)=(1-A^2r^2)\bigg[1-\frac{2m}{r}+\frac{a^2+e^2}{r^2}\bigg]+\frac{r^2+a^2}{\ell^2},\nn\\
g(\theta) =
1+2mA\cos\theta+\bigg[A^2(a^2+e^2)-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\bigg]\cos^2\theta,\nn\\ 
\Sigma=1+\frac{a^2}{r^2}\cos^2\theta. 
\label{eq:metricfg}
\end{gather}
The remaining parameters, $a$, $e$, $m$, $A\geqslant 0$ are related to the
angular momentum, charge, mass and acceleration of the black hole. In this
section we will review various restrictions this spacetime imposes to the metric
parameters. We will then also briefly discuss the existence of conical defects
in the spacetime.
\subsection{Coordinate ranges and parametric restrictions}
\label{sec:parameters}
To explore what restrictions might apply to the parameters in this metric, we
must require the spacetime to not admit closed timelike curves. This is achieved
by requiring that the signature of the metric is preserved (up to an overall
sign flip due to the conformal factor when $r$ crosses $\infty$) throughout the
patch covered by this set of coordinates. We have
\begin{gather}
t\in\mathbb{R}, \qquad 0\leqslant\theta\leqslant\pi, \qquad 0\leqslant \phi<2\pi.
\end{gather}
Missing above is a domain for the $r$-coordinate, which is given by requiring
that $r$ cover the range over which $f(r)$ is positive, delimited by the outer
horizon radius at one end and either the acceleration horizon radius, or in the
case there is no such horizon, the location of the boundary ($\theta>\pi/2$) or
infinity ($\theta\leqslant\pi/2$) at the other. We can also harmlessly extend
the spacetime beyond infinity for $\theta<\pi/2$ by including values of
$r<r_\bd$ which are largely negative. Whether there is or isn't an acceleration
horizon depends on the other parameters, and is viewed as a phenomenological
consequence of this choice. Finally, it might also be possible to extend this
spacetime beyond the horizons, which would allow one to consider further values
of $r$, however this is not covered in this paper.

While the above deals with any possible sign flips from $f(r)$, there are also
negative regions for $\Omega^2 g_{\theta\theta}$ and $\Omega^2 g_{\phi\phi}$
that we must exclude. This amounts to requiring that $g(\theta)>0$, or,
equivalently, requiring that there be no roots of
\begin{align}\label{eq:gx}
P(\xi) = 1+ 2mA\xi+\left(A^2(a^2+e^2)-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right)\xi^2
\end{align}
over $-1<\xi<1$. This leads to the following set of conditions for the black
hole parameters: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:conditions}
a^2\bigg[\frac{1}{\ell^2}-A^2\bigg] \leqslant 1-2mA+e^2A^2 \quad \mbox{and}
  \quad mA\leqslant 1. 
\end{align}
For small parameter values, the first constraint may be interpreted as a general
upper bound on acceleration, charge and rotation, however we will explore its
implications further below. The second is a necessary condition for small
acceleration (more specifically, when $P^{\prime\prime}(0)$ is positive yet
small enough to allow for the existence of real roots), without which the first
condition is not possible. Dropping charge\footnote{ The inlusion of charge
  does not drastically change the characteristics of the diagrams in
  \cref{fig:aA}, as long as the conditions in \cref{eq:conditions} are
  satisfied.}, \cref{fig:aA} serves as a visual aid to the constraints. For
small acceleration (rotation), we see the ``upper bound" behaviour, highlighted
above, to the rotation (acceleration) parameter. For larger values, a lower
bound must be respected to preserve the geometry. \Cref{sec:critC} concerns
black holes that lie along this constraint line (blue), which occur when
$P(\xi)$ in \cref{eq:gx} has a root at $\xi = -1$, or when $g(\theta_- =\pi)=0$.

\subsection{The conical defect}
The conical defect inherent to the C-metric is controlled through the parameter
$K$. A conical deficit is associated to the presence of a cosmic string attached
to the black hole with tension $\mu = \delta/8\pi$. One may introduce such
defects to simpler spacetimes. For example, one may write the Schwarzschild
metric in this fashion, by having with $g^{\mathrm{Sch}}_{\phi\phi}\sim
K^{-1}$. For $K>1$, the result is a black hole with a string running through its
core. The defect along both the $\theta = 0$ and $\theta= \pi$ axes is the
same. The C-metric has unequal deficits, and the resulting string tension
imbalance is what physically drives the acceleration.

The angular part of the metric in \cref{eq:metric} near the poles is
\begin{align}
ds^2 \sim \frac{1}{\Omega^2}\frac{\Sigma r^2}{g(\theta_{\pm})}\bigg[d\rho^2 +
  \frac{g^2(\theta_{\pm}) \rho^{2}}{K^2}d\phi^2\bigg]. 
\end{align}
where $\theta = \theta_{\pm} \pm \rho$ with $\theta_+=0$ and $\theta_-=\pi$. The
conical deficits along each axis are given by 
\begin{align}\label{eq:deficits}
\delta_\pm=2\pi\bigg[1-\frac{g(\theta_\pm)}{K}\bigg] = 2\pi\bigg[1-\frac{1\pm
  2mA + A^2(a^2+e^2)-a^2/\ell^2}{K}\bigg]. 
\end{align} 
The tensions of cosmic strings connecting the event horizon to the boundary are
related to the deficits, and given by $\mu_\pm=\delta_\pm/8\pi$. It is now
evident how our choice of $K$ will impact the geometry of the spacetime,
specifically it will regulate the distribution of tensions along either axis. It
is also worth mentioning that a negative deficit (corresponding to an excess) is
possible, however this would be sourced by a negative energy object. We can
remove one of the deficits for the C-metric by defining $K=L_\pm$ where
\begin{align}
L_\pm=1\pm 2mA + \bigg[A^2(a^2+e^2)-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\bigg].
\end{align}
Since having $K=L_-$ induces an excess at the other pole, it is generally the
custom to have $K=L_+$, regularising the north pole, and only having a string at
the south pole. In \cref{fig:embed3D} we illustrate how changing $K$ affects an
embedding of the horizon in $\mathbb{E}^3$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The critical limit for the generalised C-metric}
\label{sec:critC}

As we have shown above, the C-metric provides a mechanism through which we can
construct a black hole with strings of unequal tension at either pole, through
various choices of the parameters $A$ and $K$. The term critical, in this
section, is used to describe a black hole where at least one of the tensions is
maximal, as in the ultra-spinning black hole. This occurs when the deficit is
taken to its upper limit, $2\pi$. While for Kerr-AdS, this corresponds to an
upper bound on rotation, for the generalised C-metric, it actually corresponds
to a set of bounds, upper and sometimes lower, for the parameters of not only
rotation, but charge and acceleration too.

The critical limit for the C-metric is defined as the parametric limit required
for $\delta_- \to 2\pi$, since $\delta_-\geqslant \delta_+$. We read off, from
our definition of the conical deficits in \cref{eq:deficits}, that this occurs
when $g(\theta_-)=0$, or $P(-1)=0$ from \cref{eq:gx}. We have already determined
this in \cref{sec:parameters}, when investigating parametric restrictions on the
C-metric. The case we are interested in actually corresponds to the solid blue
lines in \cref{fig:aA}, described by the relation
\begin{align}\label{eq:us}
a^2 = \ell^2 \frac{1-2mA+e^2A^2}{1-A^2\ell^2},
\end{align}
the condition for criticality.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.2\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{embed3Dus-smooth}

  C-metric for $m=9\ell$, $A=0.04\ell$ and (a) $K=L_+$, (b) $K=1.2L_+$, (c)
  $K=2L_+$.} 
\end{figure}

This relation, combined with \cref{eq:conditions} provides more stringent
conditions in parametric space for which critical C-metrics exist. Indeed,
requiring that the right-hand side of \cref{eq:us} be positive allows us to draw
the following criteria. We have two possibilities, either
\begin{align}\label{eq:case1}
A<\frac{1}{\ell},\quad \mbox{and}\quad 2mA<\min \{1+e^2A^2,2\},
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}\label{eq:case2}
A>\frac{1}{\ell}, \quad e^2A^2<1, \quad \mbox{and} \quad 1+e^2A^2<2mA<2.
\end{align}


For this limit to be sensible physically, we must ensure that the singularity
remain shielded by an event horizon. While for the general C-metric we are
limited to numerical techniques in determining when a horizon is formed --- this
is displayed in \cref{fig:aA}, somewhat spoiling the results of the upcoming
paragraph --- we are able to analytically determine expressions for the horizons
in the absence of charge\footnote{Again, we do not expect charge to dramatically
  alter the observations laid out in this section, however it does mute our
  ability to perform this analysys numerically}.

We are interested in determining the relationship between the parameters $A$,
$l$ and $m$ (with $a$ given by \cref{eq:us}) for which the function $f(r)$
exhibits a double root. The adjacent sections in parameter space will then
correspond to a naked singularity and one which has (at least) a horizon. Let
$r_\dr$ denote the location of the extremal horizon. We then use $f(r_\dr)=0$ to
find $m=m(r_\dr)$ when the spacetime is extremal, and use it to factorise
\begin{align}
f(r)\big|_{m=m(r_\dr)}=\frac{r-r_\dr}{r^2}\overline{f}(r).
\end{align}
Since $r_\dr$ is a double root of $f(r)$, we also have $\overline{f}(r_\dr)=0$,
which yields a constraint on the parameters,
\begin{align}
 (1+Ar_\dr)\left[\Big(A^{2}-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)r_\dr^2-1\right]\left[\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)r_\dr^3-\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)r_\dr^2+3Ar_\dr-1\right]=0.
\end{align}
This has a couple of possible solutions. The first two factors give
\begin{align}
r_\dr &=- \frac{1}{A} \qquad m = \frac{1}{2A^3\ell^2},\nn\\
r_\dr &= \pm\frac{\ell}{\sqrt{A^2\ell^2-1}}\qquad m =0
\end{align}
with the corresponding value of $m$ also given. The solutions to the cubic
equation in the third factor may be parametrised using hyperbolic or
trigonometric functions. To do so we treat $0\leqslant A\ell\leqslant 1$ and
$A\ell>1$ separately as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item for $0\leqslant A\ell \leqslant 1$, we write $A\ell=\sin 3\chi$. The three
  real solutions are then
\begin{align}
r_\dr = \frac{\ell}{\tan\bar{\chi}\cos3\bar{\chi}}, \qquad m =
  \frac{\ell}{2\sin^3\bar{\chi}}\frac{1-4\sin^2\bar{\chi}}{8\sin^2\bar{\chi}-5},
\end{align}
where $\bar{\chi} = \chi + 2\pi n/3$, and $n \in \{-1,0,1\}$.
\item for $A\ell > 1$, we write $A\ell=\cosh 3\eta$. There is one real solution
  and it reads
\begin{align}
r_\dr = \frac{\ell}{\coth\eta\sinh 3\eta}, \qquad m =
  \frac{\ell}{2\cosh^3\eta}\frac{4\cosh^2\eta-1}{8\cosh^2\eta-5}. 
\end{align}
\end{itemize}

The mapped output of these solutions is displayed in \cref{fig:horroots}, which
displays the parametric regions which result in spacetimes containing either no
horizons, an outer event horizon, an acceleration horizon, or both. More
importantly, this confirms that it is therefore indeed possible to reach this
limit while avoiding a naked singularity.

separated into two regions, one which describes slowly accelerating black holes
without an acceleration horizon (lighter shade), and another for spacetimes with
an acceleration horizon (darker shade).}

\section{Thermodynamics of the critical C-metric}

\subsection{The super-entropic black hole}
\label{sec:uskerr}

An interesting feature of the ultra-spinning black hole lies in its
thermodynamic description. As alluded to in the introduction, this spacetime
seems to have more entropy than it should by violating the reverse isoperimetric
inequality, which caps entropy based on the thermodynamic volume of a black hole
spacetime. Before going into more details, it will be useful to briefly review
the work of Gibbons et al.~\cite{Gibbons:2004ai} on the thermodynamics of the
(uncharged) Kerr-AdS black hole, and generalise it using ideas similar to those
in ~\cite{Appels:2017xoe}, to show how the thermodynamic mass is altered by the
presence of a (possibly dynamical) conical deficit. One key insight from this
paper was that for this metric, the boundary actually has a non-zero angular
velocity,
\begin{align}
\Omega_\infty = \lim_{r\to\infty} -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = aK
  \frac{r^2/\ell^2}{a^2 r^2 \sin^2\theta/\ell^2- r^2 g(\theta)} = -
  \frac{a}{\ell^2} \frac{K}{L}, \qquad L = 1-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}
\end{align}
implying that the total angular velocity ought to be re-normalised. Another
takeaway from this paper is that mass must be adjusted to $M=m/L^2$ for the
first law to hold, which is acutely pointed out. In~\cite{Appels:2017xoe}, we
used the principle of correction terms such as this to derive a first law for
the non-rotating accelerating black hole, allowing for varying cosmic string
tensions (related to the conical deficit via $\mu = \delta/8\pi$). We now follow
the same prescription to derive a first law for the rotating black hole which
also admits varying string tensions. The first step is to vary $f(r_+)=0$ to
establish an initial relation, leading (after some algebra) to
\begin{align}\label{eq:master-al}
\delta\left(\frac{m}{K}\right)=T\delta S +V_0\delta P + \Omega_0\delta J -
  2r_+\delta\mu + \frac{m\delta K}{2K^2}. 
\end{align}

While this looks like a first law, it is necessary to remember that $K$
parametrises the tension and can therefore not appear as a standalone term. The
aim of this derivation is precisely to find such a first law. 
We have already identified $S$ as a quarter of the horizon area and $T$ as the
temperature given by the euclideanisation procedure. Explicitly, they are given
by 
\begin{align} \label{eq:SandT-al}
S = \frac{\pi}{K}(r_+^2+a^2) \qquad
  T=\frac{1}{2\pi(r_{+}^{2}+a^{2})}
  \bigg[m-\frac{a^{2}}{r_{+}}+\frac{r_{+}^{3}}{\ell^{2}}\bigg].  
\end{align}
We write $V_0$ and $\Omega_0$ in anticipation of correction terms however it is
worth noting that $\Omega_0=\Omega_H$ is the angular velocity at the horizon and
that $V_0$ satisfies a ``reduced" Smarr relation given by $m/K =
2(TS-PV_0+\Omega_0 J)$. Again, explicitly, 
\begin{align} \label{eq:horpotentials-al}
\Omega_0 =  \frac{a K}{r_{+}^{2}+a^{2}}, \qquad J=\frac{ma}{K^2}, \qquad V_0 =
  \frac{4\pi}{3K}r_+(r_+^2+a^2), \qquad P = \frac{3}{8\pi\ell^2}, 
\end{align}
where the expression for $J$ is a direct result from the Komar integral using
background subtraction. 

Next, we write $\Omega = \Omega_0+\Omega_1$, $V = V_0 + V_1$ and establish
\begin{align} \label{eq:flt-al}
T\delta S + V\delta P + \Omega \delta J - 2\lambda \delta \mu = \delta
  \left(\frac{m}{K}\right) + \Omega_1\delta J -\frac{3V_1}{4\pi \ell^3}\delta
  \ell + 2(r_+-\lambda)\delta\mu -\frac{m}{2K^2}\delta K. 
\end{align}
We now turn our attention to the mass. We use the following ansatz for the mass
and perturb it,  
\begin{align}
  M&=\frac{m}{K}\gamma(a,\ell),\\
  \qquad \delta M &= \delta \left(\frac{m}{K}\right) +\frac{m}{K}(\gamma_{,a}
                    \delta a + \gamma_{,\ell}\delta\ell)\nn\\
   &= (\gamma - a\gamma_{,a})\delta \left(\frac{m}{K}\right) +
\gamma_{,a}K\delta J + \frac{m a \gamma_{,a}}{K^{2}}\delta K +
\frac{m}{K}\gamma_{,\ell}\delta \ell.
\label{eq:varm-al}
\end{align}
Using \cref{eq:deficit-al} and $\mu=\delta/8\pi$ to express $\delta K$ in
terms of $\delta \mu$, \todoopt{we probably ought to discuss in general the
  validity of assuming the first law to extract other quantities}and requiring
\cref{eq:varm-al,eq:flt-al} be equal, we can infer a differential equation that
$\gamma$ ought to satisfy, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq1al}
\left(1+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right)\gamma-
  \left(1-\frac{a^{2}}{\ell^{2}}\right)a\gamma_{,a}-1=0 
\end{align}
as well as the following expressions for the correction terms, defining them in
terms of $\gamma$. 
\begin{gather}
V_1=-\frac{4\pi}{3K}\frac{m
  \ell^2}{1+a^2/\ell^2}\left(\left(1+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right)
  \ell\gamma_{,\ell}+2\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}a
  \gamma_{a}+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right),\nn\\  
\Omega_1=K\gamma_{,a}\left(1-2\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\frac{1}{1+a^2/\ell^2}\right)-
\frac{aK}{\ell^2}\frac{1}{1+a^2/\ell^2},\nn\\ 
\lambda=r_+-\frac{m}{1+a^2/\ell^2}\left(2a\gamma_{,a}+1\right). 
\end{gather}
We also require that the Smarr relation, which is obtained from the potentials'
scaling properties~\cite{Kastor:2009wy}, also be satisfied. Inserting the
expressions above into
\begin{align}
M = 2(TS-PV+\Omega J),
\end{align}
we obtain another differential equation for $\gamma$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:eq2al}
\left(1+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right)(\gamma-\ell\gamma_{,\ell})-2a\gamma_{,a}-1=0.
\end{align}
It is then straightforward to solve \cref{eq:eq1al,eq:eq2al} and one obtains
\begin{gather}
\gamma = \frac{1}{L}\left(1+\frac{a}{\ell}\zeta\right),\qquad \lambda = r_+ -
\frac{m}{L^2}\left(1+\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}+\frac{2a}{\ell}\zeta\right), \nn\\  
\Omega_1 = \frac{aK}{\ell^2 L}\left(1+\frac{\ell}{a}\zeta\right), \qquad V_1 =
\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{ma^2}{KL}\left(1+\frac{\ell}{a}\zeta\right), 
\end{gather}
where $\zeta$ is an integration constant. We can fix it by identifying $\Omega_1
= -\Omega_\infty$ provided $\zeta = 0$, which also assures that the angular
velocity of the boundary vanishes for $a=0$.\todoopt{provide explanation with
  parity argument}
\footnote{
  One can repeat this derivation with the inclusion of charge $Q=e/K$ and
introduce a correction term to the potential $\Phi=\Phi_0+\Phi_1$. This leads to
a similar expression for $\gamma$, with $\zeta$ now a function of charge
\begin{align}
  \gamma =
\frac{1}{L}\left[1+\frac{a}{l}\zeta\left(\frac{e^{2}}{l^{2}}\frac{1}{L^{2}}\right)\right].
\end{align}
Substituting this in for the following correction terms satisfies
the first law for a charged, rotating black hole with potentially varying
tensions.
\begin{gather}
  V_1=-\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{m a^2}{K(1+a^{2}/\ell^{2})}\left[2a\gamma_{,a}+2e
\gamma_{,e}-\left(1+\frac{\ell^2}{a^2}\right)\ell\gamma_{,\ell}+1\right], \qquad
\lambda = r_+-\frac{m}{1+a^2/\ell^2}(2a\gamma_{,a}+2e\gamma_{,e}+1), \nn\\
\Phi_1 = m\gamma_{,e},\qquad \Omega_1=-\frac{aK}{\ell^2(1+a^2/\ell^2)}
\left[a\gamma_{,a}\left(1-\frac{\ell^2}{a^2}\right)+2e\gamma_{,e}+1\right]
=\frac{aK}{\ell^2
L}\left[1+\frac{\ell}{a}\zeta\left(\frac{e^{2}}{l^{2}}\frac{1}{L^{2}}\right)\right].
\end{gather}
The same argument as above can be used to set $\zeta=0$.
}

Among these expressions is $\lambda$, a ``thermodynamic length'' conjugate to
the string tension. \todoopt{this paragraph pasted from previous draft.}
Comparing this with thermodynamic volume, we see that analogous to $V$, the
first term is a length - that of the string from the pole to $r=0$, and the
second term is a mass-dependent correction that normalises this thermodynamic
length.  It can be understood by thinking of the two ways in which a cosmic
string can affect the black hole: First, by introducing a conical deficit, the
relation between the mass of the black hole and the solution mass parameter $m$
is corrected, since the internal energy of the black hole will be reduced by a
factor of $4\mu$ if a conical deficit is present.  The second effect comes from
the energy of the string behind the event horizon - although this does not
formally seem to contribute to the mass of the black hole - if the deficit
increases, then the black hole must give some ``extra mass'' to the string
inside the event horizon, commensurate with the increased deficit.

Let us consider now the $a\to\ell$ limit. As mentioned above, this causes the
original, smooth, Kerr-AdS metric to diverge, and if precautionary measures are
taken to allow for conical defects, it has the effect of freezing out the
tension and decoupling $K$ as a physical parameter. This can be seen from
\cref{eq:deficit-al}: in this limit, $K$ is no longer linked to the deficit, and
therefore to the tension either. Now that we also have the thermodynamic
quantities, we see that some of these also diverge, through their dependence on
the function $\gamma\sim L^{-1}$. In particular, the angular velocity of the
boundary diverges hence the `ultra-spinning' label attributed to this
limit. That $\gamma$ diverges poses the main problem for resolving the first
law.

This decoupling of $K$ from $\mu$, or rather that combined with the fact that
$\mu$ is now seemingly constant does however hold interesting implications for
the primitive first law in \cref{eq:master-al}, which, itself, does not
diverge. The $\delta \mu$ piece obviously vanishes, and we are free to set
$\delta K=0$ too, since it is purely a gauge choice at this point, it no longer
has physical significance. This leaves a functioning first law for the
ultra-spinning black hole, with thermodynamic potentials, given (with $a=\ell$)
in \cref{eq:SandT-al,eq:horpotentials-al}, distinct from the regular Kerr-AdS
black hole. These can be related to those
in~\cite{Hennigar:2014cfa,Hennigar:2015cja} by recognising that
$K=2\pi/\bar{\mu}$ (where the bar allows for distinction from what we define as
tension, and $\bar{\mu}$ is the periodicity of their redefined azimuthal
coordinate).

\todoopt{slight repolish needed here}
Having obtained expressions for the volume and horizon area of the black hole,
we may now discuss the reverse isoperimetric conjecture. The statement is that
the isoperimetric ratio
\begin{align} \mathcal{R}_D =
  \bigg[\frac{(D-1)V}{\omega_{D-2}}\bigg]^{\frac{1}{D-1}}
  \bigg[\frac{\omega_{D-2}}{\mathcal{A}}\bigg]^{\frac{1}{D-2}},
\end{align} where $V$ is the thermodynamic volume, $\mathcal{A}$ is the event
horizon area and $\omega_{D-2}$ is the area of a unit surface at constant $t$,
is always greater than or equal to 1. Physically, it is equivalent to say that
for a given thermodynamic volume, entropy is maximised by a spherical black
hole. Using $\omega_2=4\pi/K$ in $D=4$, we find that
\begin{align} \mathcal{R} =
\sqrt[6]{\frac{r_{+}^{2}}{r_{+}^{2}+\ell^{2}}}\leqslant 1,
\end{align} and the conjecture is violated. The existence of a super-entropic
black hole would naively imply the existence of other near-ultra-spinning
super-entropic black holes however the physical discontinuity between this black
hole and regular Kerr-AdS spacetimes prevents this train of
logic. \todoopt{Implications for conjecture validity?} 

\subsection{The critical non-rotating C-metric}
\label{sec:critnrC}

\todoopt{present soltuions with integration constant and explain why set to zero}
We now turn our attention to the C-metric. Let us strip \cref{eq:metric} to the
uncharged non-rotating case. The metric reads
\begin{gather}
ds^2 = \frac{1}{(1+Ar\cos\theta)^2}\bigg\{ -f(r)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{f(r)} +
r^2\bigg[\frac{d\theta^2}{g(\theta)} + g(\theta) \sin^2\theta
\frac{d\phi^2}{K^2}\bigg]\bigg\},\nn\\ 
f(r)=\bigg[1-\frac{2m}{r}\bigg](1-A^2r^2)+\frac{r^2}{\ell^2}, \qquad g(\theta) =
1+2mA\cos\theta, 
\label{eq:metricnr}
\end{gather}
and the condition from \cref{eq:conditions} for $g(\theta)$ to not have a root
over $(0,\pi)$ is now $mA\leqslant 1/2$. From \cref{eq:deficits}, the limiting
case $mA = 1/2$ corresponds to having a non-compact horizon with a $2\pi$
deficit along the $\theta = \pi$ axis, once again, regardless of the choice of
$K$. This limit has already been mentioned in
\cite{Chen:2015vma,Hubeny:2009ru}. Unlike \cref{sec:uskerr} however, we still
have the possibility of a defect at $\theta = 0$. The tension of the string
running from the north pole is $\mu_+ = (K-2)/4K$, and K does in fact still have
a physical role in the spacetime. All this means is that this fact, combined
with the absence of any divergences other than those at the horizons, implies
that we do not need to treat this spacetime any different to its non-critical
counterpart.

Following~\cite{Appels:2016uha,Appels:2017xoe}, we can examine the
thermodynamics of this system to determine whether the isoperimetric conjecture
holds. The first law of black hole thermodynamics,
\begin{align}\label{eq:firstlawnr}
\delta M = T\delta S + V\delta P - \lambda_+ d\mu_+ - \lambda_- d\mu_-,
\end{align}
is satisfied with the following quantities,
\begin{gather}
M=\frac{m}{K},\qquad T=\frac{1}{2\pi
  r_+^2}\bigg[m(1-A^2 r_+^2) + \frac{r_+^3}{\ell^2(1-A^2 r_+^2)}\bigg], \qquad
S=\frac{\mathcal{A}}{4} = \frac{\pi r_+^2}{K(1- A^2 r_+^2)},\nn\\ 
V=\frac{4 \pi  r_+^3}{3 K (1- A^2 r_+^2)^2}, \qquad P=\frac{3}{8\pi \ell^2},
\qquad \lambda_\pm = \frac{r_+}{1\pm A r_+} - m,
\end{gather}

From here we can safely take the critical limit $2mA = 1$. The last term in
\cref{eq:firstlawnr} vanishes and none of the quantities above diverge. Finally,
seeing as $\mu_+$ is still related to $K$ and we therefore need not treat this
particular limit any different, we expect the isoperimetric
conjecture to be obeyed. The isoperimetric ratio is
\begin{align}
\mathcal{R} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[6]{1-r_+^2/4m^2}}\geqslant 1.
\end{align}

Therefore, despite the non-compact horizon, its entropy does fall below the
bound imposed unto it by the isoperimetric inequality. 

\subsection{Deriving thermodynamic potentials from the first law}
In \cref{sec:uskerr,sec:critnrC}, we employed previously established
thermodynamic techniques and applied them to the corresponding critical
geometries. We now enter the realm of rotating accelerated black holes, for
which the literature is thin. \todoopt{mention astorino somehow} We will,
however, approach this geometry following a similar procedure as in those
sections and attempt to make sufficient headway so as to draw certain
conclusions concerning the critical limit. 

In what follows, we will attempt to derive an expression for the mass of the
black hole as well as other thermodynamic quantities by demanding that the first
law hold,
\begin{align}\label{eq:fullFLT}
\delta M = T\delta S + \Omega \delta J + \Phi \delta Q + V \delta P  - \lambda_+ d\mu_+ - \lambda_- d\mu_-
\end{align}
To do so in an appropriate fashion, we will impose that entropy be a quarter of
the outer horizon area, and that the temperature be that obtained by
regularising the euclidean form of this metric. To clarify, we write out all
expressions explicitly, 
\begin{gather}
T= \frac{f^\prime (r_+)}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{2\pi(r_+^2+a^2)}\left(m(1+A^2 r_+^2)-\frac{a^2+e^2}{r_+}+r_+^3\Big(\frac{1}{\ell^2}-A^2\Big)\right), \nn\\
S = \frac{\mathcal{A}}{4} = \frac{\pi(r_+^2+a^2)}{K(1-A^2 r_+^2)}.
\label{eq:TS}
\end{gather}
We will also preserve the following forms for the charge $Q$, angular momentum $J$, pressure $P$,
\begin{gather}\label{eq:QJP}
Q=\frac{e}{K}, \qquad J = \frac{m a}{K^2}, \qquad P = -\frac{\Lambda}{8\pi} = \frac{3}{8\pi \ell^2},
\end{gather}
and complete the set of extensive variables by including the tensions
$\mu_\pm=\delta_\pm/8\pi$ as defined by \cref{eq:deficits}. We will be
decomposing the angular velocity $\Omega$, electrical potential $\Phi$ and
thermodynamic volume $V$ into two terms
\begin{align}\label{eq:X}
X=X_0+X_1
\end{align}
in order to separate reasonably\footnote{By reasonably, we are referring to
  conventional (see, for example~\cite{Gibbons:2004ai}) ways of deriving the
  quantities in question, but applying them to the current geometry. These are
  all well-motivated for more standard black holes and therefore are
  \emph{reasonable} choices.} well-defined quantities, denoted by $X_0$, and
correction terms, $X_1$ whose existence is required to satisfy the first law,
and whose explicit form left to be determined in what follows. We have, to
begin,\todoopt{expression for $\Phi_0$?}
\begin{gather}\label{eq:OP0}
\Omega_0 = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}}\bigg|_{r=r_+} = \frac{a
  K}{r_+^2+a^2}, \qquad \Phi_0 = \frac{e r_+^2}{r_+^2+a^2}. 
\end{gather}
Thermodynamic volume is usually determined through the Smarr/scaling Euler
relation. We will take $V_0$ to be that which satisfies the reduced Smarr
relation given as
\begin{align}\label{eq:Smarr0}
\frac{m}{K} = 2(TS-PV_0+\Omega_0 Q)+\Phi_0 Q.
\end{align}
A straightforward re-arrangement of \cref{eq:TS} reveals
\begin{align}\label{eq:V0}
V_0 = \frac{4\pi r_+ (r_+^2+a^2)}{3 K (1-A^2 r_+^2)^2}.
\end{align}
Finally, we introduce a function $\gamma(A,a,e,l)$ which we will be using to
determine an explicit form for the mass,
\begin{align}\label{eq:defM}
M=\frac{m}{K} \gamma(A,a,e,l),
\end{align}
as well as explicit expressions for the correction terms introduced above.

To establish the first law, one usually begins by considering perturbations of
$f(r_+)=0$. The result can usually simply then be massaged directly into the
first law itself. Proceeding this way, making use of all the definitions given
above, the closest one can get to an expression which resembles the first law is
the full form of the expression we have been using throughout the previous
sections as the initial starting point of this derivation. In fact, the
procedure remains much the same, however we will proceed in full, as this is a
crucial part in this write-up. One eventually obtains
\begin{align}\label{eq:mKFLT}
\delta \frac{m}{K} = T\delta S + \Omega_0 \delta J + \Phi_0 \delta Q + V_0
  \delta P - \frac{r_+}{1+Ar_+} \delta \mu_+ - \frac{r_+}{1-Ar_+}\delta \mu_-
  +\frac{m\delta K}{2K^2}. 
\end{align}
One then combines \cref{eq:fullFLT} with \cref{eq:mKFLT} from which it follows that
\begin{align}
\delta M = \delta \frac{m}{K} + \Omega_1 \delta J + \Phi_1 \delta Q + V_1 \delta
  P - \left(\lambda_\pm - \frac{r_+}{1\pm Ar_-}\right) \delta \mu_\pm -
  \frac{m}{2K^2}\delta K. 
\end{align}
We will be comparing this to what a variation of $M$ as defined in
\cref{eq:defM} yields. In order to be able to do so term-by-term, we must ensure
that all the variations are independent. In particular, using
\cref{eq:deficits}, as well as variations of \cref{eq:QJP}, we can re-express
$\delta K$ and, for good measure, $\delta A$ as
\begin{align}
\delta K &=\frac{2K^2}{m\Delta}(1+a^2A^2+\Delta) \delta \frac{m}{K} \nn -
           \frac{2aK}{m\Delta}\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)\delta
           J-\frac{2eA^2K^2}{\Delta}\delta Q-\frac{2a^2K}{\ell^3\Delta}\delta
           \ell\\ 
&\qquad\qquad\qquad -\frac{2K^2}{m\Delta}\big(m-A(a^2+e^2)\big)\delta\mu_+
                     -\frac{2K^2}{m\Delta}\big(m+A(a^2+e^2)\big)\delta\mu_-,
                     \nn\\ 
\delta A &=-\frac{A K}{m}\delta\frac{m}{K}-\frac{K}{m}\delta\mu_+ +
           \frac{K}{m}\delta \mu_-, \qquad \qquad \Delta =
           -1+A^2(a^2+e^2)-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}. 
\label{eq:dKdA}
\end{align}
It immediately follows that
\begin{multline}
\delta M = \delta\frac{m}{K} \Big(1-\frac{1+a^2A^2+\Delta}{\Delta}\Big) 
+\delta J \bigg(\Omega_1+\frac{aK}{\Delta}\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)\bigg) 
+\delta Q \bigg(\Phi_1+\frac{meA^2}{\Delta}\bigg) \\
+\delta\ell \Big(-\frac{3}{4\pi\ell^3}+\frac{ma^2}{K\ell^3\Delta}\Big) 
+\delta \mu_+\Big(\frac{r_+}{1+Ar_+}-\lambda_+
+\frac{1}{\Delta}\big(m-A(a^2+e^2)\big)\Big)\\ 
+\delta \mu_-\Big(\frac{r_+}{1-Ar_+}-\lambda_+
+\frac{1}{\Delta}\big(m+A(a^2+e^2)\big)\Big). 
\label{eq:dM1}
\end{multline}

To perform the term-by-term comparison, we must write out perturbations of $M$
in terms of the same quantities as those above. For this we can use variations
$Q$ and $J$ (\cref{eq:QJP}) as well as those for $K$ and $A$ outlined above in
\cref{eq:dKdA} to eventually obtain 
\begin{align}
\delta M = &~\delta\frac{m}{K}\bigg((\gamma-A\gamma_{,A}+a\gamma_{,a}\Big(\frac{2}{\Delta}(1+a^2A^2+\Delta)-1\Big)+\frac{2e}{\Delta}\gamma_{,e}(1+a^2A^2+\Delta)\bigg) \nn\\
&+K\delta J\bigg(\gamma_{,a}\Big(1-\frac{2a^2}{\Delta}\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)\Big)-\frac{2ea}{\Delta}\gamma_{,e}\Big(A^2-\frac{1}{\ell^2}\Big)\bigg) \nn\\
&+m\delta Q\bigg(-\frac{2eaA^2}{\Delta}\gamma_{,a}+\gamma_{,e}\Big(1-\frac{2e^2A^2}{\Delta}\Big)\bigg) \nn\\
&+\frac{m}{K}\delta\ell\Big(\gamma_{,\ell}-\frac{2a^3}{\ell^3\Delta}\gamma_{,a}-\frac{2ea^2}{\ell^3\Delta}\gamma_{,e}\Big) \nn\\
&+\delta \mu_+\Big( -\gamma_{,A}-\frac{2a}{\Delta}\big(m-A(a^2+e^2)\big)-\frac{2e}{\Delta}\gamma_{,e}\big(m-A(a^2+e^2)\big)\Big) \nn\\
&+\delta \mu_-\Big( \gamma_{,A}-\frac{2a}{\Delta}\big(m+A(a^2+e^2)\big)-\frac{2e}{\Delta}\gamma_{,e}\big(m+A(a^2+e^2)\big)\Big).
\label{eq:dM2}
\end{align}

Now that we have obtained two expressions for the variation of $M$, one from its
explicit definition, and one through its relation with the first law, we can
require these be equal to determine what functional form $\gamma$ must have to
obtain a set of thermodynamic quantities for this geometry that obey the first
law.  Doing so yields a set of differential equations which can be separated out
into five equations that determine correction terms from $\gamma$
\begin{align}
\Omega_1 &= K \gamma_{,a} \bigg(\frac{2 a^2}{\Delta} \Big(\frac{1}{\ell^2}-A^2\Big)+1\bigg) + \frac{2 a e K}{\Delta}\gamma_{,e} \Big(\frac{1}{\ell^2}-A^2\Big)+\frac{a K}{\Delta} \Big(\frac{1}{\ell^2}-A^2 \Big),\nn\\
\Phi_1 &= \frac{m}{\Delta}\Big(-2 e a A^2\gamma_{,a}+(\Delta-2 e^2 A^2)\gamma_{,e}-eA^2\Big) ,\nn\\
V_1 &= \frac{4 \pi  m }{3 \Delta K}(-\Delta l^3 \gamma_{,\ell}+2 a^3 \gamma_{,a}+2 a^2 e \gamma_{,e}+a^2),\nn\\
\lambda_\pm &= \frac{r_+}{1\pm Ar_+}\pm \gamma_{A} + \frac{1}{\Delta}(2a\gamma_{,a} + 2e \gamma_{,e} + 1)\big(m\mp A(a^2+e^2)\big) ,
\label{eq:corrTermsWithGamma}
\end{align}
and a differential equation for $\gamma$, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:diffg1}
\Delta(\gamma-A\gamma_{,A})+2e\gamma_{,e}(1+a^2A^2+\Delta))+a\gamma_{,a}(2+2a^2A^2+\Delta)+1+a^2A^2=0.
\end{align}
We also need these quantities to satisfy the Smarr relation
\begin{align}
M=2(TS-PV+\Omega J) + \Phi Q.
\end{align}
We can use \cref{eq:QJP,eq:X,eq:OP0,eq:Smarr0,eq:V0,eq:defM} together to reduce
the Smarr relation above into another differential equation for $\gamma$, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:diffg2}
\Delta(\gamma - \ell\gamma_{,\ell}) + e\gamma_{,e}(2+2a^2A^2+\Delta)+2a\gamma_{,a}(1+a^2A^2)+1+a^2A^2 = 0.
\end{align}

With these two differential equations, we can discuss solving them. Subtracting
one from the other provides a first hint at the form of $\gamma$, which is so
familiar it could have been guessed at. We infer 
\begin{align}
a\gamma_{,a} + e\gamma_{,e} + \ell\gamma_{,\ell} - A \gamma_{,A} = 0 \qquad \Longleftrightarrow \qquad \gamma(A,a,e,\ell) = \phi\Big(\frac{a}{\ell}, \frac{e}{\ell}, A\ell\Big).
\end{align}
We re-write \cref{eq:diffg1} in terms of new unitless parameters $x=
a^2/\ell^2$, $y=e^2/\ell^2$ and $z=A^2\ell^2$, 
\begin{multline}
\phi(1+x-z(x+y))-2x \phi_{,x}(1-x+z(3x+y))-4y\phi_{,y}(-x+z(2x+y))\\-2z\phi_{,z}(1+x-z(x+y))-1-zx=0.
\end{multline}

This equation has exact solutions for $x=0$ and $z=0$, either the non-rotating
case or the non-accelerating case, as have been outlined in previous
sections. It is possible to solve this equation perturbatively with respect to
either variable at least up to order $x^2$ or $z^2$ however for brevity, we
shall only keep next-to-leading order terms, and set integration constants to
$0$. For example, writing $\phi = \phi^{(0)}+z\phi^{(1)}+\mathcal{O}(z^2)$, we
may use the zeroth order solution to solve the equation at first order, given by
\begin{align}
&x+\phi^{(0)}(x+y)+2x\phi^{(0)}_{,x}(3x+y)+4y\phi^{(0)}_{,y}(2x+y)+\phi^{(1)}(1+x)+2x\phi^{(1)}_{,x}(1-x)-4xy\phi^{(1)}_{,y}\nn\\
&\qquad= \frac{(1+x)(x^2+2x+y^2)}{(1-x)^2}+\phi^{(1)}(1+x)+2x\phi^{(1)}_{,x}(1-x)-4xy\phi^{(1)}_{,y} = 0.
\end{align}
To second order in $A$ (first order in $z$), $\gamma$ is given by
\begin{align}
  \gamma^{(A\ell\ll 1)} &= \frac{1}{1-a^2/\ell^2}\nn\\
     &\qquad -\frac{A^2\ell^2}{4} \left(\frac{1+4e^2/\ell^2+3
       a^4/\ell^4}{\left(1-a^2/\ell^2\right)^2} +\frac{\ell}{2a}
       \left(1-\frac{a^2}{\ell^2}\right) \log\frac{1-a/\ell}{1+a/\ell}\right)
       +\mathcal{O}(A^4\ell^4). 
\label{eq:gamsmallA}
\end{align}
Alternatively, it is also possible to consider perturbations around $x=0$, for
small rotation parameter. Performing much the same as above, we find
\begin{align}\label{eq:gamsmalla}
\gamma^{(a\ll \ell)} = \frac{1}{1+e^2A^2}+\frac{a^2}{4e^2}\left(\frac{1+4e^2/\ell^2+3 A^4 e^4}{\left(1+e^2A^2\right)^2}-\left(1+e^2A^2\right) \frac{\arctan(A e)}{A e }\right)+\mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{a^4}{\ell^4}\Big).
\end{align}

Obtaining these solutions means that we are now able to write down, admittedly
at low order, expressions for the correction terms and the mass in the small
acceleration limit (\cref{sec:smallAsol}) and in the small rotation limit
(\cref{sec:smallasol}) using \cref{eq:defM,eq:corrTermsWithGamma}. For
convenience, we re-write the mass
\begin{align}
M=\frac{m}{K}\gamma.
\end{align}
\todoopt[inline]{correction terms all in appendices.}
\subsection{Thermodynamics of the critical generalised C-metric}
Let us now return to the critical limit introduced above and examine how this
limit affects the thermodynamics of the system using the results from the
previous section. While the perturbative techniques used constrain us in
parameter space, the initial set-0 nature of the ultra-spinning case hints that
either this behaviour extends continuously to other critical limits, or it truly
is set-0 and remains disconnected from other geometries in physical parameter
space.  A characteristic feature of the ultraspinning limit was that the angular
velocity, $\Omega$, evaluated at the boundary, diverges. The angular velocity
for the general C-metric is
\begin{align}
\Omega=\text{@@@@@@@@}
\end{align}
\todoopt[inline]{Pick a formula for angular velocity - either general or with
  boundary limit taken} 

Another way to potentially draw any parallels with the non-accelerated case is
by looking at the thermodynamic potentials. As explained above, certain
thermodynamical quantities for the KNAdS solution blow up in the ultra-spinning
limit. This is a direct consequence of the fact that $\gamma$, in the absence of
acceleration, diverges for $a\to\ell$. However, the presence of an acceleration
parameter shifts this limit to what is presented in \cref{eq:us}. $\gamma$, in
the critical limit and for small acceleration, expands to
\begin{align}
\gamma^{(A\ell\ll 1)}\Big|_{\mathrm{us}}=\frac{1}{2Am} - \frac{A\ell^4}{8m^3}\Big(1+\frac{e^2}{\ell^2}\Big)^2-\frac{A\ell^2}{4m}+\mathcal{O}(A^2\ell^2).
\end{align}
This is clearly finite for $A\neq 0$. We therefore expect similar behaviour for
the remaining potentials. The correction to the angular velocity, for example,
expands to
\begin{align}
\Omega_1^{(A\ell\ll 1)}\Big|_{\mathrm{us}} = \frac{-K}{2\ell}+\frac{K}{2mA\ell}-\frac{A K\ell^3}{8m^3}\Big(1+\frac{e^2}{\ell^2}\Big)^2-\frac{A K}{4 m\ell}(m^2-e^2)+\mathcal{O}(A^2\ell^2).
\end{align}
